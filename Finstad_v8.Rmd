# Abstract

In boreal lakes, the browning of freshwater is raising concerns about the quality of drinking water and potential ecosystem disturbances. The reduced sulphur deposition and warmer climate, together with the abandonment of pastures and the growing forestry industry, result in an increased flux of TOC from catchments to freshwater, and, subsequently, to coastal waters. In this article, we investigate the impact of several catchment characteristics on the TOC concentration in 4000 lakes sampled in 1995. We find that the amount of biomass on the catchment (with NDVI as a proxy), the proportion of peatland and arable land, the runoff and the nitrogen deposition are the main explanatory predictors. This model is then extended to coastal drainage basins in 2050 and 2100, using the forecasts of climatic variables as expected in two of the Share Socio-economic Pathways: 1-2.6 (+2°C) and 3-7.0 (+4,5°C). Both scenarios result in an increased export of TOC from land to coastal waters, with SSP 3-7.0 leading to the most significant increase of TOC in freshwater.  

# Introduction 

In Nordic boreal lakes, increased flux of natural organic matter (NOM) from catchments to rivers and lakes has resulted in a widespread darkening of freshwater, a phenomenon referred to as browning. This trend has been documented since the 1980s [@Monteith2007], when several monitoring programs were implemented to document the effect of acid deposition abatement policies. The two successive Sulphur protocols of Helsinki in 1985 and in Oslo 1994 [@UNECE] caused a strong decline in acid deposition, which is currently at preindustrial levels [@EuropeanEnvironmentAgency2011]. The change in water quality in Norway was assessed by regional synoptic surveys, one in 1986 [@Henriksen1989] and one in 1995 (Northern European Lake Survey, [@Henriksen1998]. The former covered 1 000 lakes in Norway, while the latter survey included also almost 4 000 lakes in Sweden, Finland, Denmark, as well as Scotland, Wales and Russian Kola and Karelia. A 50% decrease of sulfur deposition was observed between the period 76-85 and the period 95-2001 [@Menz2004; @Fagerli2019; @Garmo2020]. Several studies demonstrated that this reduced sulphate load has increased the solubility of dissolved organic matter (DOM), thereby increasing the concentration of total organic carbon (TOC) in surface waters [@DeWit2007a; @Monteith2007]. Sulfur deposition is now back at such low levels that significant further reductions will be challenging to achieve [@Grennfelt2020]. Any further increase in surface water TOC will thus primarily be driven by other environmental factors such as re-/afforestation and other land use changes, as well as changes in hydrology and temperature due to climate change. 

Climate change is a main driver for most ecosystem processes, especially increasing precipitation.  Changed runoff patterns are expected to lead to an increased flushing of TOC to surface waters  [@DeWit2016a]. Longer growing seasons increase the primary production and thereby the biomass in the catchments, which increases the production of TOC and subsequently causes browning of surface waters [@Larsen2011; @Finstad2016; @Kritzberg2020]. @Finstad2016, modelling the increase of DOM concentrations in 70 Norwegian lakes over 30 years, found that the increase in terrestrial biomass (based on the increase in Normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI, as its proxy) along with increasing temperature were significant temporal drivers for the increase in freshwater DOM concentration.  Accumulated nitrogen from atmospheric deposition due to anthropogenic activities is also expected to lead to a higher production of biomass [@DeVries2019]. In addition, land-use changes tend towards more and more intensive forestry practices. Abandonment of small-scale farming using out-field resources as grazing pastures for husbandry has resulted in increased standing forest biomass during the last centuries [@Myrstener2021]. In the coming decades, afforestation is expected to develop further, as the governments of Norway, Sweden and Finland (collectively referred to here as Fennoscandia) consider forest as a trade-off leverage for offsetting their carbon emissions and reaching their zero-emission goals [@NordicCouncilofMinisters2021].  

The planned intensification of forest management and re-/afforestation has raised concern regarding the water quality [@NorskVann]. Most of the raw water sources used for producing drinking water in Fennoscandia are surface waters, and browning has thus a potential impact on water quality and treatment to ensure potability of water [@Eikebrokk2004]. In addition, browning has a suite of ecosystem impacts on lakes, e.g. by increasing light absorbance, and thus reducing primary production [@Karlsson2007;  @Thrane2014]. At the same time, browning may increase the CO2 and CH4 emissions especially in small lakes [@Yang2015; @DeWit2018], further increasing the net heterotrophy that prevails in boreal lakes [@Hessen1990; @Tranvik2009]. Reduced primary production propagates up the trophic ladder and also affects fish, both via reduced productivity, but also by affecting visual feeding [@Finstad2014] and thermal regimes [@Karlsson2009; @Craig2017]. The current browning of freshwater lakes and rivers also entails the darkening of coastal waters [@Opdal2019a]. Measures of the Secchi depth in the Baltic Sea have shown that the water steadily became less transparent since the beginning of the 20th century. It has been suggested that the increases of TOC concentration in surface freshwater led to an increase of the export of TOC to the coastal water, with subsequent eutrophication phenomena [@Fleming2012; @Opdal]. 

Understanding the governing factors for TOC concentration under local anthropogenic and regional climatic pressures is therefore essential to forecast its potential detrimental effects to the water quality and ecosystem services. 

@Larsen2011a developed an empirical model for predicting the spatial distribution of TOC concentrations in the 1 000 Norwegian lakes of the 1995 Northern European Lake Survey [@Henriksen1998]. The model was based on the lake catchment characteristics, using catchment NDVI (Normalized Differential Vegetation Index), area fractions of peat (Bogs) and area specific (relative) runoff intensity (Runoff) as predictors. This study concluded that NDVI was the key predictor of surface water TOC, and NDVI explained, together with fraction of bogs plus runoff, nearly 80% of observed variation in TOC. 

The 1000 lakes used to fit the model cover a very heterogeneous landscape comprising large gradients in TOC, altitude, longitude, and forest cover, with large subalpine and alpine areas. For this reason, the model predictions may not be very representative of the boreal biome at large. To test the assumption that the key catchment properties NDVI, Bogs and Runoff can serve as explanatory predictors for TOC at wider spatial scale, this study included an additional 3 735 lakes and their catchments properties from Sweden and Finland. These sites represent more low-altitude land, productive forests, larger areas of bogs and with more uniform topography and runoff. Other conceptually relevant predictors at the catchment level were also included in this study: Temperature, Precipitation, proportion of Forest and Arable land, Nitrogen and Sulfur deposition.  

A spatial error linear model (SELM) is used as a modelling tool to account for the spatial autocorrelation of the response and predictor variables. Based on the fitted model, the effect size (i.e., magnitude of effect on TOC) of a relative increase of each of the predictor variables are estimated. The fitted model is tested on data from a recently re-sampling of the 1000 lakes, conducted by NIVA in 2019 [@NIVA2020]. The fitted model is then used to forecast future average TOC concentration in an ensemble of Fenno-Scandinavian watersheds draining into the sea (referred to thereafter as “coastal drainage basins”). Following the IPCC AR6 report, two scenarios are considered: the SSP 1.2-6 scenario, with global warming limited to less than 2°C, and the SSP 3-7.0 where global warming can reach up to 4°C. Finally, these scenarios are gathered to estimate the future export of TOC into coastal waters. With these models, we aim at testing two distinct hypotheses: 1) whether a space-for-time approach, using a spatial “snap-shot” to predict future changes, can yield good forecast results; and 2) that global warming, together with land-use changes, with increased standing biomass and runoff, is likely to exacerbate the ongoing browning of freshwaters and, subsequently, also coastal darkening. 


# Methods

## Data preparation 

The dataset comprised the `r dim(fennoscandia)[1]` lakes sampled during the Northern Lake Survey in 1995 [@Henriksen1998]. The NOFA database gathers the data about the lake, as well as the catchment polygons, defined with a digital elevation model.  Nine explanatory parameters, describing each of the lake catchments, were compiled as predictor variables. The predictors are: NDVI; proportion of forest (Forest), arable land (Arable) and peatland (Bog); mean runoff (Runoff) and precipitation intensity (Precip); mean temperature (Temp); total nitrogen (TNdep) and total sulphur (TSdep) deposition. These descriptors were computed as mean values of each parameter over the catchment (`r fig_nums("insert-maps", display = "c")`).  The complete procedure for extraction, compilation and preparation of historic data is available in [Supplementary 1](https://camilmc.github.io/TOC_trend_1995/Supp1_nsf_model.html). The test dataset, provided by the Norwegian Institute for Water Research [@NIVA2020], comprised 1001 lakes sampled in 2019. The lakes were matched with the catchments and data of the Northern European Lake Survey (see [Supplementary 2](https://camilmc.github.io/TOC_trend_1995/Supp2_NIVA_model.html)).  

* The total organic carbon (TOC) concentration in mgC/L (`r fig_nums("toc-maps", display = "c")`a)were extracted from the Northern European Lake Survey dataset from 1995 and from the 1000-lakes-survey in 2019. As the TOC concentration values were skewed, the data were log-transformed (logTOC) to normalize the distribution.

* Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (`r fig_nums("insert-maps", display = "c")`a) or the summer months (June, July, and August) were downloaded from the GIMMS database [@NCAR2018] for 1994, i.e., the year preceding sampling. For the 2019 dataset, data from 2015 is used, as it was the latest available year in the GIMMS database. NDVI is used as a proxy for the density of vegetation (primarily forest) biomass [@Beck2007].  

* Mean runoff (Runoff) values in mm/y (`r fig_nums("insert-maps", display = "d")`b) were derived from the CORDEX historical model. The period 1970-2000 was used for the 1995 data, and the period 1985-2015 was used for the 2019 data [@CORDEXvERC; @Kreienkamp2012]. As the runoff intensities were skewed the data were log-transformed (logRunoff) to normalize the distribution. 
* Mean annual precipitation (Precip) in mm/y (`r fig_nums("insert-maps", display = "c")`e) and temperature (Temp) and temperature (Temp) in ºC (`r fig_nums("insert-maps", display = "c")`d) for the years 1970 to 2000 were downloaded from the WorldClim database [@WorldClim]. As the precipitation distribution was not normally distributed the data were log transformed (logPrecip). They were not used for the NIVA dataset, and not downloaded for the corresponding period.  

*	Proportions of peatland (Bog), arable land (Arable) and forested area (Forest) (`r fig_nums("insert-maps", display = "c")`e, f, and g, respectively) within each catchment are computed from the Corine Land Cover (CLC) database [@CopernicusCLC], and correspond to the data of 2000, as land use data prior to this were not available. Several CLC categories were merged to create the three categories used in this study (see [Supplementary 1](https://camilmc.github.io/TOC_trend_1995/Supp1_nsf_model.html). For the 2019 dataset, Corine Land Cover data for 2018 were used. Although distributions of the different land use are not normally distributed, they are not log transformed due to many zeros in the data. Other transformations (square, square roots) did not contribute to normalizing the distribution. 

*	Total nitrogen deposition (TN-dep) data in mgN/m2 and total sulphur deposition (TSdep) data in ugS/m2  (`r fig_nums("insert-maps", display = "c")`h and i, respectively) were extracted from EMEP models as the sum of dry and wet deposition [@EMEP; @EMEP2012]. Data from 2000 was used as these were the earliest available data, resulting in a slight underestimation of TN- and TSdep, as deposition has been decreasing since the 90s. For the 2019 dataset, EMEP data from 2019 was used.  

## Spatial TOC models

@Larsen2011a used a multiple linear regression model (LM) to predict the effect of climate change on the TOC concentration in 1 000 Norwegian lakes. In this study, including almost 4 000 lakes in Sweden and Finland, a similar linear model is reproduced to investigate the role of the three predictors selected by Larsen et al. as well as other conceptually relevant predictors in explaining the spatial differences in TOC levels in Norwegian, Swedish, and Finish lakes. 

The spatial autocorrelation of all the predictors were determined by computing Moran’s I (see details in [Supplementary 4](https://camilmc.github.io/TOC_trend_1995/Supp4_effect_size.html)).All variables were spatially autocorrelated. To take this into account, a Spatial Error Linear Model was fitted with the same predictors as for the LM and the results compared. 

The LM and SELM models are fitted and estimates (i.e., slope “a” as in the simple model $y=ax+b$) evaluated both on scaled and unscaled variables. The scaled estimates (computed with centered and normalized variables) were used to compare the impact of the predictor variables on a standard deviation scale, while the unscaled estimates were used to compute the effect sizes. The equations used to calculate the effect size for each pair response/predictor variable are explained in [Supplementary 4](https://camilmc.github.io/TOC_trend_1995/Supp4_effect_size.html).

## Test of the Spatial Model on 1000-lakes-survey (2019) data

In 2019, a large survey covering 1000 Norwegian lakes was realized by the Norwegian Institute for Water Research [@NIVA2020]. The same lakes as in 1995 were sampled again and TOC concentration measured. Catchment polygons were computed with an elevation model. Land-cover data come from the Norwegian mapping service [@Kartverket]. Nitrogen and Sulfur deposition are EMEP data compiled by the Norwegian Institute for Air Research [@NILU2012]. Precipitation and Temperature data were extracted from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF, ERA5 dataset [@ECMWF2019]). NDVI data was also extracted from GIMMS database [@TheNationalCenterforAtmosphericResearch2018] for the purpose of this study. Details about the data from NIVA is available in Supplementary 3. 


## Forecast of TOC prediction in sea watersheds

Future changes in TOC concentrations are predicted using the SELM with 5 main predictors: NDVI, logRunoff, Bogs, Arable and TNdep. In order to cover the whole territory of Fennoscandia, and not only some of the studied lakes catchments, we used polygons representing the coastal drainage basins. These basins are the ensemble of the watercourse that drain into the sea within a coastal section [@NVE]. The coastal drainage basins were defined using an elevation model delineated from a 10 m digital terrain model obtained from The Norwegian, Swedish and Finnish Mapping Authorities [@ninanor]. After cleaning, the dataset is composed of 1 392 polygons (see [Supplementary 3](https://camilmc.github.io/TOC_trend_1995/Supp3_wr_model.html)). .

Future changes in climate parameters are based on predicted changes in climate drivers derived from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (Phase 6) (CMIP6), run by the World Climate Research Program [@WRCP22] using two different socio-economic pathways [@Riahi2017]: SSP1-2.6 as the best scenario, assuming the global warming will be limited to less than 2°C, and SSP 3-7.0 as the worst-case scenario [@Hausfather2019; @CORDEX2021]. Several institutions run the CMIP6 models to forecast future climate. Based on @Raju2020, the results from the model developed by the Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques (CRNM) were selected to extract future runoff, temperature, and precipitation values. 

Since there is no forecast for NDVI in CMIP6, summer NDVI values for 2050 and 2100 were instead predicted using a spatial error model based on forecast for temperature and precipitations in the period 2041-2060 and for the period 2081-2100. This model was fitted using summer NDVI, temperature and precipitations in 1995. Modeled NDVI and changes in NDVI in the future are shown in [Supplementary 3](https://camilmc.github.io/TOC_trend_1995/Supp3_wr_model.html). 

TN is also not modelled for the future and depend on the SSP chosen. Between 2000 and 2020, TNdep has already decreased for both reduced and oxidized nitrogen [@EEA2021]. Further evolution of TNdep in the two forecasts is estimated based on the estimation for future N emissions. According to the Sixth Assessment of the IPCC report [@IPCC2019], the NOx emissions are going to decrease slightly for the SSP 1-2.6 (from 11 to 9 Mt/y) and increase for SSP 3-7.0 (from 11 to 21 Mt/y). There are no projections for oxidized nitrogen, so we estimated NH3 to decrease by around 20% between 2020 and 20100, and to remain the same for SSP 3-7.0. 

## Selection of predictor variables

### Spatial distribution of predictors

Spatial distribution of the mean values of NDVI, Runoff, Precip, Temp, Bogs, Arable, Forest, TNdep and TSdep, describing each of the `r dim(fennoscandia)[1]` lake catchments are shown in (`r fig_nums("insert-maps", display = "c")`).

```{r insert-maps, fig.dim = c(30,48), fig.align = "center"}
listgrob <- list("map.ndvi.png","map.Runoff.png","map.Precip.png","map.temp.png","map.Bog.png","map.arable.png","map.forest.png","map.tndep.png", "map.tsdep.png") %>% lapply(readPNG) %>% lapply(rasterGrob)
#grid.arrange(grobs = listgrob, ncol = 3)
all.map <- plot_grid(plotlist = listgrob, ncol= 3, nrow = 3, align = "v", greedy = T, labels = c("a)","b)","c)","d)","e)","f)","g)","h)","i)"), label_size = 20)
save_plot("predictor.maps.png",all.map, ncol = 3, nrow = 3, base_height = 8, base_width = 6)
print(all.map)
```

<div align = 'center'>*`r fig_nums("insert-maps", "Maps of the predictor variables: NDVI (a), mean runoff intensity (Runoff, b), temperature (Temp, c), precipitation intensity (Precip, d), proportion of peat (Bog, e), proportion of forest (Forest, f), proportion of arable land (Arable, g), total nitrogen deposition (TNdep, h) and total sulfur deposition (TSdep, i) in the studied catchments")`*</div>

### Pearson Correlation coefficient, autocorrelation and Variance Inflation Factor

```{r p-I-VIF}
m <- c("logTOC","NDVI","logRunoff","logPrecip","Temp","Bog","Arable","Forest","TNdep","TSdep")
cor.mat <- cor(dplyr::select(fennoscandia,m[-1]))

lm.all <- lm(data = fennoscandia, formula = as.formula(paste(m[1],"~",paste(m[-1],collapse = "+"))))
lm.vif <- car::vif(lm.all) %>% as.data.frame() %>% setNames("VIF")

cor.toc <- apply(dplyr::select(fennoscandia,m[-1]),2,cor,fennoscandia$logTOC) %>% as.data.frame() %>% setNames("Cor.toc")

moran.df <- readRDS("moran.df.Rdata")

moran.limit <- 1/(dim(fennoscandia)[1]-1)

moran.vif.df <- merge(moran.df,lm.vif, by.x = "parameter", by.y = 0) %>% merge(cor.toc, by.x = "parameter", by.y = 0)
moran.vif.df[,2:5] <- round(moran.vif.df[,2:5],2)
moran.vif.df <- moran.vif.df[,-3]
```

Predictor variables that are too strongly correlated (multi-collinear) reduce the robustness of linear models and the precision of their estimates [@Vittinghoff2012]. Here, we investigate the Pearson Correlation coefficients for each pair of variables (response and predictor), shown in `r table_nums("corrplot", display = "c")`. In addition, the Moran's I of each variable was calculated (`r table_nums("moran-vif-table", display = "c")`). to estimate the spatial autocorrelation of each variable. Considering the large number of observations, the maximum Moran’s I value for a non-autocorrelated variable would be `r format(moran.limit,scientific = T, digits = 2)`. All variables in this study had a Moran’s I above this limit, indicating a high degree of autocorrelation. Finally, the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), indicating the severity of multi-collinearity due to a single predictor, was computed and presented in `r table_nums("moran-vif-table", display = "c")`.

The Pearson correlation coefficient matrix in `r table_nums("moran-vif-table", display = "c")` highlights several groups of predictors.  

TNdep, TSdep and Temp were closely correlated, in particular TNdep and TSdep with r =  `r round(cor(fennoscandia$TNdep,fennoscandia$TSdep),2)`. The correlation coefficient between TNdep and Temp is `r round(cor(fennoscandia$Temp,fennoscandia$TNdep),2)` and the correlation coefficient between TSdep and Temp is `r round(cor(fennoscandia$Temp,fennoscandia$TSdep),2)`. This is because both N and S deposition are mainly from long-range transported NOx and SO2 emissions in Europe. The nitrate and sulphate deposition is thus higher in the southern regions of Fennoscandia where the temperature is also higher. Additionally, the extremely high correlation is also because both S and N deposition are based on emission inventories and are calculated with the same meteorological model. TSdep also has the highest VIF (VIF = `r round(lm.vif["TSdep",],2)`), followed by TNdep (VIF = `r round(lm.vif["TNdep",],2)`). Temp, TNdep and TSdep have a very high Moran's I too (all around 0.9) showing a very strong spatial pattern. Because of the interaction between these three predictors, only one can be used in the model. Even though TSdep has been highlighted by several studies as the main predictor of TOC concentration [@Monteith2007], we chose to keep TNdep as a predictor for atmospheric deposition in this study, considering that biologic relevance of N as generally the limiting factor for terrestrial primary production.  The effect of temperature is partly captured by NDVI, so Temp was not chosen either to represent this group of variables.  

Forest and NDVI were also closely correlated (r =  `r round(cor(fennoscandia$Forest,fennoscandia$NDVI),2)`), even if they do not match as closely as could be effected. Even if the resolution of the Corine Land Cover dataset is finer than the NDVI dataset, NDVI is slighly more closely correlated to logTOC (r =  `r round(cor(fennoscandia$logTOC,fennoscandia$NDVI),2)`) than Forest (r =  `r round(cor(fennoscandia$logTOC,fennoscandia$Forest),2)`). Even though the spatial resolution of Forest cover from the Corine Land Cover dataset is finer than that of the NDVI dataset, the latter taking into account all types of vegetation. Moreover, it reflects the density of the vegetation, and is thus likely a better indicator for total standing biomass. Also, NDVI will better reflect the photosynthetic activity of plants by representing greenness. Finally, theVIF of NDVI was lower than that of of Forest (`r round(lm.vif["NDVI",],2)` compared to `r round(lm.vif["Forest",],2)`), showing that it is less correlated to the other predictor variables. Therefore, NDVI was kept as a vegetation biomass proxy in this study. Bog and Arable proportion were not highly correlated to any other variable and both had low VIF and Moran’s I. Therefore, both were kept in the model as predictors. 

LogRunoff and LogPrecip were also highly positively correlated (r =  `r round(cor(fennoscandia$Forest,fennoscandia$NDVI),2)`). LogPrecip had a highest VIF than logRunoff (`r round(lm.vif["logPrecip",],2)` compared to `r round(lm.vif["logRunoff",],2)`), showing more general correlation to the other predictors, but a lower Moran's I (`r round(moran.df[which(moran.df$parameter == "logPrecip"),2],2)` compared to `r round(moran.df[which(moran.df$parameter == "logRunoff"),2],2)`). Conceptually, surface runoff is a more relevant predictor for TOC export from catchment to surface waters than precipitation: a part of the precipitation volume evapotranspirates or infiltrates into ground reservoirs and does not reach the water bodies. Moreover, logRunoff is stronger correlated to logTOC (r =  `r round(cor(fennoscandia$logTOC,fennoscandia$logRunoff),2)`) than logPrecip (r =`r round(cor(fennoscandia$logTOC,fennoscandia$logPrecip),2)`). LogRunoff intensity was therefore selected as the preferred transport related predictor in the model. 

Bog and Arable proportion were not highly correlated to any other variable and both had low VIF and Moran's I. Therefore, both of them were kept in the model as predictors.

# Results and discussion 

## Modelling of TOC concentration on the Northern Lake Survey dataset

A multiple Linear Model (LM) and a multiple Spatial Error Linear Model (SELM) were fitted for the log TOC on the 5 predictors selected in the previous section. The SELM takes into account the spatial autocorrelation of the predictor variables in the error term of the regression. To compare the two models, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was calculated. The AIC for each model is presented in Supplementary 1. 

Both models were fitted with and without scaled variables. This allows a comparison of the regression coefficients and effect size for each predictor variable. The results are presented in `r fig_nums("compare-plots-5", display = "c")`). 

Scaled estimates (hereafter referred to as $\beta$, fitted on response and predictors variables that are centered and scaled, show the degree of contribution of each predictor to the response variable value but not the extent of this impact on the real scale. The effect sizes are expressed as percent change in TOC concentration caused by: a 1% increase in NDVI (0.01 on the NDVI index); a 0.01 increase in logRunoff (corresponding to 1% increase of the original runoff); Forest, Bog and Arable land coverage (proportion increase of 0.01); a 25 µg/m2 increase of nitrogen deposition (1% of the range of TNdep). The relative change of 1% is arbitrarily chosen to represent the impact of each predictor variable on a comparable basis. This means that a $1 \%$ change of the predictor $x$, with an effect size $\delta x$ in catchment A would result in a final TOC concentration in lake A of $TOC_{A}+\delta x∗TOC_{A}$ where $TOC_{A}$ is the initial TOC concentration.

In both LM and SELM, the strongest predictor for logTOC is the NDVI. LM gives an higher impact to NDVI with an estimate of  `r round(s.lm.coef.5[which(s.lm.coef.5$Parameter == "s.NDVI"), which(names(s.lm.coef.5) == "Estimate")],2)` and an effect size of `r round(lm.effectsize.5[which(lm.effectsize.5$Parameter == "NDVI"), which(names(lm.effectsize.5) == "Percent")],2)`%, while SELM gave a scaled estimate of `r round(s.sem.coef.5[which(s.sem.coef.5$Parameter == "s.NDVI"), which(names(s.sem.coef.5) == "Estimate")],2)` and an effectsize of `r round(sem.effectsize.5[which(sem.effectsize.5$Parameter == "NDVI"), which(names(sem.effectsize.5) == "Percent")],2)`%. 

LogRunoff had high scaled estimates, especially for the LM with $\beta$ (`r round(s.lm.coef.5[which(s.lm.coef.5$Parameter == "s.logRunoff"), which(names(s.lm.coef.5) == "Estimate")],2)`, while SELM had $\beta$ (`r round(s.sem.coef.5[which(s.sem.coef.5$Parameter == "s.NDVI"), which(names(s.sem.coef.5) == "Estimate")],2)`). The effect size of a 1% increase has a negative effect on the TOC concentration (`r round(lm.effectsize.5[which(lm.effectsize.5$Parameter == "logRunoff"), which(names(lm.effectsize.5) == "Percent")],2)`% for LM and `r round(sem.effectsize.5[which(sem.effectsize.5$Parameter == "logRunoff"), which(names(sem.effectsize.5) == "Percent")],2)`% for SELM).The explanation for this negative effect is that the dilution effect is on average stronger than the increased flux of dissolved soil organic matter.  The original spatial repartition of TOC concentration could also impact this result, as the highest runoff values are located in the steep mountain areas in Norway, where the soil is thin and the TOC concentration low.  

Bog, despite its low correlation with logTOC (`r round(cor(fennoscandia$logTOC,fennoscandia$Bog),2)`), has relatively high scaled estimates (`r round(s.lm.coef.5[which(s.lm.coef.5$Parameter == "s.Bog"), which(names(s.lm.coef.5) == "Estimate")],2)` for LM and `r round(s.sem.coef.5[which(s.sem.coef.5$Parameter == "s.Bog"), which(names(s.sem.coef.5) == "Estimate")],2)` for SELM) and effect sizes (`r round(lm.effectsize.5[which(lm.effectsize.5$Parameter == "Bog"), which(names(lm.effectsize.5) == "Percent")],2)`% for LM and `r round(sem.effectsize.5[which(sem.effectsize.5$Parameter == "Bog"), which(names(sem.effectsize.5) == "Percent")],2)`% for SELM). confirming the role of Bog as an important predictor for TOC concentration. This article does not consider the possible evolution of the proportion of bogs. Still, Bog evolves slowly, and their area-wise proportion is assumed to be quite constant over timescales relevant for our study. They can however experience short-term extreme events, such as droughts, which are likely to happen at increased frequency, especially in the south of the boreal zone [@Helbig2020]. However, since we base our TOC forecast on 20-year averages of the main predictors (precipitation and temperature to predict NDVI, as well as runoff), the impact of extreme events on the TOC average is considered limited. 

Arable land had negligible impact on TOC, along with a relatively low negative effect size (`r round(lm.effectsize.5[which(lm.effectsize.5$Parameter == "Arable"), which(names(lm.effectsize.5) == "Percent")],2)`% for LM and `r round(sem.effectsize.5[which(sem.effectsize.5$Parameter == "Arable"), which(names(sem.effectsize.5) == "Percent")],2)`% for SELM). Agricultural soils store indeed less carbon than forest and bogs, but the use of phosphate fertilizers could have affected the primary production and thus the levels of autochthonous DOM in lakes via eutrophication. This effect does however not seem to be preponderant factor governing DOM levels in the studied region.  

TNdep had positive impact on TOC concentration (r = `r round(cor(fennoscandia$logTOC,fennoscandia$TNdep),2)`), with both relatively high positive scaled estimates (`r round(s.lm.coef.5[which(s.lm.coef.5$Parameter == "s.TNdep"), which(names(s.lm.coef.5) == "Estimate")],2)` for LM and `r round(s.sem.coef.5[which(s.sem.coef.5$Parameter == "s.TNdep"), which(names(s.sem.coef.5) == "Estimate")],2)` for SELM) and effect sizes (`r round(lm.effectsize.5[which(lm.effectsize.5$Parameter == "TNdep"), which(names(lm.effectsize.5) == "Percent")],2)`% for LM and `r round(sem.effectsize.5[which(sem.effectsize.5$Parameter == "TNdep"), which(names(sem.effectsize.5) == "Percent")],2)`% for SELM). The positive effect of TNdep on TOC is at the onset surprising as the deposition of acid rain, including the strongly correlated TSdep, is found to have a negative effect on TOC concentration in several studies [@Garmo2020, @DeWit2007a, @Monteith2007].  This can be due to the spatial repartition of TNdep: it is higher in the southern and warmer part of Scandinavia, where other factors such as high NDVI could explain the high TOC concentrations.  It can also be due to the fertilizing effect of the accumulating TNdep on the biomass. Future impact of nitrogen deposition depends on public policies, as it is linked to combustion of fossil fuel and agricultural uses in central Europe. Here, the effect size is calculated for an increase of 25 µg/m2 of TNdep, but yearly TNdep might either decrease in the coming decades (SSP 1-2.6) or remain stable (SSP 3-7.0).  

The SELM model had a lowest AIC (Aikaike Information Criteria) than the LM model (see [Supplementary 1](https://camilmc.github.io/TOC_trend_1995/)). It also resulted in estimates being less extreme than the LM. Especially, NDVI and Runoff have lower estimates and effect sizes with SELM than with LM. On the other hand, TNdep had higher estimate and effect size with SELM compared to LM. This shows that the model is more balanced and less likely to over- or underestimate the impact of each predictor. Moran’s I of the residuals is higher for the LM than for the SELM, showing a stronger spatial pattern of the errors in LM. The SELM model performs therefore better in predicting the TOC concentration in boreal lakes and will be assessed further in the next section. 



## Validation against a new 1000-lakes-survey  

The 2019 dataset of the 1000-lakes-survey, provided by NIVA, was used to perform a real-size test of the space-for-time model. The model fitted on the Fennoscandic 1995 data was used to predict the TOC concentration value in the 1000 lakes in 2019, and the results were compared with the actual observations. Data manipulation and predictions are presented in [Supplementary 3](https://camilmc.github.io/TOC_trend_1995/Supp3_wr_model.html). 

```{r niva-test-results, fig.dim = c(16,10)}
listgrob <- list("NIVA_test/comparison_1995_2019.png","NIVA_test/niva-test-result.png") %>% lapply(readPNG) %>% lapply(rasterGrob)
niva <- plot_grid(plotlist = listgrob, ncol= 2, nrow = 1, align = "v", greedy = T, labels = c("a)","b)"))
save_plot("niva.test.png",niva, ncol = 2, nrow = 1, base_height = 6, base_width = 8)
print(niva)
```

`r  readPNG("NIVA_test/diff.niva.png") %>% rasterGrob() %>% plot_grid(label = "c)", align = "v")`

<div align = 'center'>*`r fig_nums(name = "niva-test-result",caption = "Real-data test of the SELM model, a) TOC concentration in 1995 and in 2019, b) predicted vs sampled log(TOC); c) map of the difference between observed and fitted log(TOC)", display = "f")`*</div>

The results show that the SELM model fitted with the 5 selected predictors gives satisfactory results, with a correlation between observed and fitted log(TOC) of 0.84. However, the model tends to under-estimate the TOC concentration in lakes with high initial TOC concentration, particularly in the south-eastern part of Norway, and over-estimate the TOC concentration in lakes with a low initial TOC concentration (`r fig_nums(name = "niva-test-result",display = "c")`).  

The space-for-time approach uses a set of explanatory values taken at a snap-shot moment in time, but in a large variety of regions, to model future changes. The relationships between the explanatory parameters and the response TOC at any single site is a result of biogeochemical processes that have developed in the soils since the last glacial epoch (i.e., about 15 000 years), e.g., the long-term processes of generating the pool of soil organic matter.  That catchments in the middle of the Norwegian mountains are predicted to have a higher TOC concentration compared to the actual observations (`r fig_nums(name = "niva-test-result",display = "c")`b) is hence likely due to a recent increased NDVI in these regions, not yet followed by the soil formation that a catchment with a similar NDVI value in 1995 would have had. Similarly, the TOC concentration of lakes in Southeast Norway are mostly under-estimated since in 1995, they were still affected by S-deposition: high TNdep, being strongly correlated to TSdep, would have meant low TOC concentration, while in 2019 the role of TNdep as a predictor is more related to the positive fertilizing effect of accumulating N in the watersheds than the negative acid rain effect.  

Having in mind these potential discrepancies, this space for time model can be used to obtain an indication of future TOC concentration under various climate conditions, as the prediction range and the difference observed/predicted in this study nevertheless serves as a good indication in most catchments.  

## Forescast with SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0

Future average TOC concentration were computed for `r dim(wr.sf.95)[1]` coastal drainage basins in Norway, Sweden and Finland. The coastal drainage basins have their outlet either to the Baltic Sea for watersheds in Sweden and Finland, or the North-, Norwegian- and Barent Seas for watersheds in Norway.  

Coastal drainage basins comprise several lakes and catchments, and there is no experimental data for their respective average TOC concentration in their various water bodies. Therefore, the first step was to compute the TOC concentration in 1995 using the SELM fitted in the above section. In a second step, the forecast of the predictor variables Temperature, Precipitation and Runoff were extracted from CMIP6 climate models based on two distinct scenarios: SSP1-2.6 (global warming limited to less than 2°C), and SSP 3-7.0 (global warming up to 4°C). NDVI was then modelled using precipitation and temperature (see [Supplementary 3](https://camilmc.github.io/TOC_trend_1995/Supp3_wr_model.html)).  It was modeled using a polynomial model, similarly to Larsen et al. [@Larsen2011].  

Future trends in TNdep was assessed based on estimations from the IPCC, resulting in a net decrease in SSP1-2.6 in 2050 and further in 2100, and a decrease followed by an increase in SSP 3-7.0, back to 1995 levels. Finally, the average TOC concentration was computed for two time periods: 2041-2060 and 2081-2100 (abbreviated as “2050” and “2100”). The details of predictor extraction and model fitting are presented in [Supplementary 3](https://camilmc.github.io/TOC_trend_1995/Supp3_wr_model.html). 

The results of the TOC forecast in sea watershed in shown in `r fig_nums("ssp-toc",display = "c")`. Here, we focus on the difference between log(TOC) fitted for the different climate scenarios, relative to the log(TOC) fitted for the Coastal drainage basins based on the 1995 data. We assume that the over- or under-estimation of TOC concentration, highlighted by the test on 2019-data, is partially compensated by this double-fit. Moreover, the TOC is forecasted as an average over a 20-years period, which likely serves to limit the “snap-shot” effect by taking into account a certain adaptation time of the system, although it does not account for centennial processes.

listgrob <- list("WR/SSP126.2050.diff.log.png", "WR/SSP126.2100.diff.log.png","WR/SSP370.2050.diff.log.png","WR/SSP370.2100.diff.log.png") %>% lapply(readPNG) %>% lapply(rasterGrob)
ssp <- plot_grid(plotlist = listgrob, ncol= 2, nrow = 2, align = "v", greedy = T)
save_plot("ssp.toc.png",ssp, ncol = 2, nrow = 2, base_height = 4, base_width = 3)
print(ssp)
```

<div align = 'center'>*`r fig_nums("ssp-toc","Forecast of TOC concentration under SSP 1-2.6 and SSP 3.7-0 (mg/L)")`*</div>

The forecasts of average TOC concentration in all the coastal drainage basins, under both scenarios, show an increase in most of Fennoscandia, with a stronger increase in the South-East of Sweden and South-West of Finland. The pattern of the change is similar for SSP 1-2.6 and for SSP 3-7.0, the latter representing the more extreme changes.  

The forecasted changes of TOC are driven by the forecasted changes in NDVI (see [Supplementary 3](https://camilmc.github.io/TOC_trend_1995/Supp3_wr_model.html)), reflecting the expected changes in biomass, reflecting in turn the temperature increase. A main effect of this increase is the reduced length of the winter snow cover, resulting in longer growing seasons and therefore a higher primary production in forests. This increase is supported by unchanged precipitation patterns in most of Fennoscandia: except for the Norwegian West Coast, where the amount of precipitation is expected to increase, the amount of precipitation will remain unchanged. This limits the potential for soil dryness and water stress, even though the water lost by evapotranspiration will increase [Gauthier2015; @DOrangeville2018]. In our space-for-time approach, the chain of processes between biomass production and carbon storage in forest soils are not fully integrated, so there might be a delay before the export of TOC from soils to surface exports starts to increase as well. Nevertheless, these results can be used as a good trend indicator. It is worth noting that, in our model, the northern coastal drainage basins are not strongly affected despite a drastic increase of temperature (up to 10 degrees). This might be due to an under-estimation of the increase in NDVI in these regions (see [Supplementary 3](https://camilmc.github.io/TOC_trend_1995/Supp3_wr_model.html)). Also, the effects of thawing permafrost are not accounted for in this study [@Abbott2014a]. Moreover, these changes in NDVI do not take into account the forest policies implemented by Norway, Sweden and Finland. The specific relationship between forest proportion and TOC concentration in studied in [Supplementary 5](https://camilmc.github.io/TOC_trend_1995/Supp5_forest_impact.html). Nonetheless, an increase of forest cover would lead to an increase of NDVI, so these results are an indication of the impact of an increased catchment biomass on TOC concentration.  

The forecasted changes of runoff are similar to the NDVI-changes patterns and match the TOC concentration evolution in the same way. The regions with higher runoff (Norwegian mountains mainly, and some basins in northern Sweden) will experience slightly less increase of TOC than the regions with decreasing runoff (Southern Sweden and Finland). A strong decrease of Runoff was observed in small coastal drainage basins on the Norwegian western coast, probably because of poor performances of the runoff model in this steep region. This has a limited impact on the TOC forecast. In both SSP scenarios, the TOC concentrations in western basins are forecasted to increase, but far less than in the southern regions where the forecasts of runoff show a slight decrease. Our model does not consider the seasonal patterns of runoff, that will be more impacted by climate change than the average yearly runoff [@Hanssen-Bauer2017]. Summer runoff will decrease in most regions, due to earlier snowmelt and more evapotranspiration, compared to winter runoff, expected to increase in most regions. These contradictory effects might balance each other: increased mobilization of soil organic carbon will increase during the winter and the spring [@Haland2017], while the residence time of the water and TOC in lakes will increase in the summer. Whether this higher concentration and residence time will result in a higher mineralization rate, and thus a higher removal rate from surface water, is subject to discussion [@DeWit2018]. Our model shows that the dilution effect (i.e., more runoff means more surface water and less residence time) is prevailing on the mobilization effect, but this requires more investigation. 

Finally, the influence of TN-dep changes are visible in Southern Norway and in the South-Western part of Sweden. In these regions, the NDVI is forecasted to increase, but it is not followed by a sharp increase in TOC concentration. As TNdep is projected to decrease drastically under SSP 1-2.6 scenario, the TOC increase in these region is limited. On the contrary, under SSP 3-7.0 2100, there is almost no change of TN-dep compared to 1995, and the TOC increase is the most visible. These observations rely on the assumption that TNdep has a positive effect on TOC concentration via a higher biomass production by removing the N-limitation of boreal forest [@Magnani2007; @Hedwall2013]. More directly, chronic TNdep might limit microbial respiration and root activities in soils, reducing SOM mineralization rates and thus increasing the pool of TOC readily exportable to surface water [@Bowden2004]. However, this effect can be a flaw of the space-for-time modelling and could reflect the spatial location of TOC-rich surface waters rather than a potential fertilization effect of TNdep. As the highest TOC concentrations are observed in south-east Sweden, while the regions most affected by TNdep are south-east Norway and south-west Sweden, we can nonetheless assume that the effects of TNdep observed in our models are related to the removal of N-limitation of the forest. In this study, the projected changes of TNdep in the future were roughly estimated and depend largely on regional regulations concerning fossil fuels burning and agricultural practices. A finer evaluation of the potential evolution of public policies would be necessary to refine the contribution of future TNdep to TOC concentration in surface waters. 


## Coastal darkening

Modelling future TOC concentration in coastal drainage basins makes it possible to estimate the future export of TOC towards the Baltic Sea and the Norwegian coast. Most coastal drainage basins in Sweden and Finland drain into to the Baltic Sea (see Supplementary 2), while Norwegian coastal basins drain in Skagerrak, in the North Sea, in the Norwegian Sea and in the Barent sea in the North [@Saetre2007]. All contribute to the Norwegian Coastal Current freshwater masses. The estimated exported TOC from each coastal drainage basin was computed as: 

$$ TOC_exp = [TOC] (mg.L^{-1}) \times Runoff (mm/y, or L.m^{-2}.y^{-1}) \times Watershed area (m^2)$$

TOC concentrations (past and future) were obtained by back transforming the results of the model (log(TOC)) into TOC in mg/L. The result of the above equation, giving the amount of TOC exported in mg, is converted to Tg. Forecasts are presented in `r fig_nums("coastal-darkening",display = "c")`. 

```{r future-darkening, fig.dim = c(12,18)}

The Baltic Sea outflow contributes 50% to the freshwater in the Norwegian Coastal Current, while freshwater runoff from Norway contributes to 40% (Sætre 2007). Under the SSP 1-2.6 scenario, the export of TOC into the Baltic Sea will increase by 5 Tg by 2050 compared to 1995, and by 8 Tg in 2100. Under the SSP 3-7.0 scenario, the total TOC import into the Norwegian Coastal Current will first increase by 7 Tg in the forecast for 2041-2060, and by 17,5 Tg for the period 2081-2100. Swedish coastal drainage basins would contribute the most to these increases. Associated with higher surface temperature, this browning of coastal water could lead to later spring bloom and spawning time. 

# Conclusion

This study demonstrates the relevance of using space-for-time models in order to forecast future regional environmental changes in TOC concentration in freshwater. The TOC concentration was best predicted by a spatial error linear model, with catchment characteristics as predictors. Long-term processes working on the catchment characteristics are not taken into account in the space-for-time approach. Nevertheless, the simulated changes from 1995 to 2019 were in good agreement with measured values (r = 0.84). NDVI, being a good proxy for the amount of biomass in the catchment, is a major predictor for TOC concentration. Runoff intensity was also a significant predictor with a negative effect on TOC concentration. The proportion of bogs on the catchment was also a good spatial predictor for TOC concentration in lakes, while the proportion of arable land had almost no effect. Finally, atmospheric deposition of nitrogen has significant positive effects on the TOC concentration in lakes. 

The forecast of TOC changes in the next century shows that the current browning is likely to increase further in the SSP3-7.0 scenario. In the SSP1-2.6 scenario, the effects of the various predictors compensate each other in several of the coastal drainage basins and the browning trend could even be reversed in some of them. The forecast for the TOC concentration in sea watershed also allowed us to realize a raw estimation of expected coastal darkening in the next century, indicating a decrease of TOC export in the SSP1-2.6 scenario and a relatively strong increase in the SSP 3-7.0 scenario.
