# Abstract

Browning of Fennoscandian boreal lakes is raising concerns among waterworks regarding the quality of their raw water sources, and environmentalists due to ecosystem perturbations. Declined sulfur deposition and warmer climate, along with less outfield grazing and an expanding forestry industry, have resulted in increased fluxes of Total Organic Carbon (TOC) from catchments to freshwater, and, subsequently, to coastal waters. This study assesses the explanatory values of several catchment characteristics on the TOC concentration in almost 5 000 lakes sampled in 1995. 

The intensity of biomass (based on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI) and the proportions of peatland in the catchment, along with runoff intensity and nitrogen deposition loading, are found as main explanatory spatial predictors for lake water TOC concentrations. A multiple linear model, based on these explanatory variables, is used to simulate TOC in runoff from coastal drainage basins in 2050 and 2100, using the forecasts of climatic variables in two of the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP): 1-2.6 (+2°C) and 3-7.0 (+4,5°C). Both scenarios result in an increased export of TOC from land to coastal waters, with SSP 3-7.0 leading to the most significant increase in TOC.


# Introduction 

In Fennoscandian boreal lakes, increased flux of natural organic matter (NOM) from catchments to rivers and lakes has resulted in a widespread darkening of freshwater, a phenomenon referred to as browning. This trend has been documented as increased Total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations since the 1980s [@Monteith2007], when several monitoring programs were implemented to document the effect of acid deposition abatement policies. The two successive Sulphur protocols of Helsinki in 1985 and in Oslo 1994 [@UNECE] instigated a strong decline in acid deposition, which is currently at preindustrial levels [@EuropeanEnvironmentAgency2011]. The changes in water quality in Norway were also assessed by regional synoptic surveys in 1986 [@Henriksen1989], in 1995 (Northern European Lake Survey, [@Henriksen1998], and in 2019 [@Hindar2020]. The former covered 1 000 lakes in Norway, while the 1995 survey included also almost 4 000 lakes in Sweden, Finland, Denmark, as well as Scotland, Wales and Russian Kola and Karelia. A 50% decrease of sulfur deposition was observed between the period 76-85 and the period 95-2001 [@Aas2001; @Fagerli2022]. This reduced sulfate load increased the solubility of NOM, thereby increasing the concentration of TOC in surface waters [@DeWit2007a; @Monteith2007]. Sulfur deposition is now at so low levels that significant further reductions will be challenging to achieve [@Grennfelt2020]. Any further increase in surface water TOC will thus primarily be driven by other environmental factors, such as changes in hydrology and temperature due to climate change, as well as re-/afforestation and other land use changes.

Changed runoff patterns are expected to lead to increased flushing of NOM to surface waters [@DeWit2016a]. Higher temperatures provide longer growing seasons that increase the primary production and thereby the biomass in the catchments, which increases the production of NOM and subsequently causes browning of surface waters [@Larsen2011a; @Finstad2016; @Kritzberg2020]. @Finstad2016 modeled the increase of TOC concentrations in 70 Norwegian lakes over 30 years. They found that a temporal increase in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), along with increasing temperature, were the main temporal drivers for the observed increase in freshwater TOC concentration. NDVI is used as a proxy for the density of vegetation (primarily forest) biomass [@Beck2007]. Accumulated reactive nitrogen from long-range atmospheric deposition is also expected to contribute to a higher production of biomass [@DeVries2019]. In addition, land-use changes are tending towards increasingly intensive forestry practices. Abandonment of out-field resources, as grazing pastures for husbandry, has resulted in increased standing forest biomass during the last centuries [@Myrstener2021]. In the coming decades, afforestation is expected to expand further, as the governments of Norway, Sweden, and Finland (collectively referred to here as Fennoscandia) consider forest as a necessary trade-off leverage for offsetting their carbon emissions and reaching their zero-emission goals [@NordicCouncilofMinisters2021].

The planned intensification of forest management and re-/afforestation has raised concern for possible effects on water quality [@NorskVann; @Vogt2022]. Raw water sources used for producing drinking water in Fennoscandia are predominantly surface waters. Browning has thus a potential impact on the water treatment to ensure potability of water [@Eikebrokk2004]. In addition, browning has a suite of ecosystem impacts oin lakes, e.g., by increasing light absorbance, and thus reducing primary production [@Karlsson2007;  @Thrane2014]. Moreover, increased influx of allochthoenous NOM boosts the heterotrophic degradation, causing increased CO2 and CH4 emissions, especially in small lakes [@Yang2015; @DeWit2018; @Hessen1990; @Tranvik2009]. Increased browning also extends the duration of thermal stratification and affects fish, both via reduced primary production, but also by the darkening affecting predators visual hunting [@Finstad2014; @Karlsson2009; @Craig2017]. Browning of freshwater lakes and rivers also brings about the darkening of coastal waters [@Opdal2019a]. Measures of the Secchi depth in the Baltic Sea have shown that the water has steadily become less transparent since the beginning of the 20th century [@Fleming-Lehtinen2012]. The increase of NOM in surface freshwater has inherently led to an increase of the export of NOM to the coastal water, with subsequent coastal darkening [@Aksnes2009].


Identifying the governing factors for TOC concentration in space and time, and understanding their role under changing anthropogenic and climatic pressures, is therefore essential to forecast NOMs potential detrimental effects to the water quality and ecosystem services.

@Larsen2011a developed an empirical model predicting the spatial distribution of TOC concentrations in the 1 000 Norwegian lakes of the 1995 Northern European Lake Survey [@Henriksen1998]. The model was based on lake catchment characteristics, using catchment NDVI, area fractions of peat (Bog) and area specific (relative) runoff intensity (Runoff) as predictors. This study concluded that NDVI was the key predictor of surface water TOC concentration, as NDVI explained, together with Bog and Runoff, nearly 80% of observed spatial variation in TOC.

The 1 000 lakes used to fit the model by Larsen et al. cover a very heterogeneous landscape, comprising large gradients in NOM, relative forest and bog coverage, and mean runoff, as well as length of growing season, with extensive subalpine and alpine areas. For this reason, the model predictions may not be representative of the more homogeneous boreal biome at large. To test the assumption that the key catchment properties NDVI, Bog and Runoff can serve as explanatory predictors for TOC concentrations at wider spatial scale, this study include an additional 3 735 lakes and their catchments properties from Sweden and Finland. These additional catchments represent more uniform topography and runoff, situated in low-altitude land of Sweden and Finland, with more extensive productive forests, and with extensive areas of bogs. Other conceptually relevant predictors at the catchment level were also included in this study: mean temperature (Temp) and rain intensity (Precip), proportion of forest (Forest) and farmland (Arable), as well as total Nitrogen (TNdep) and Sulfur deposition (TSdep).

A Spatial Error Linear Model (SELM) is used as a modelling tool to account for the spatial autocorrelation of the response and predictor variables. The fitted TOC model, based on the optimum set of predictors, is tested on data from a recent re-sampling of the 1 000 lakes, conducted by NIVA in 2019 [@Hindar2020]. Based on the model, the effect size (i.e., relative effect on TOC) of a relative increase of each of the predictor variables are estimated. The model is also used to forecast future average TOC concentration in an ensemble of Fenno-Scandinavian watersheds draining into the sea (referred to thereafter as “coastal drainage basins”). Following the IPCC AR6 report, two global warming scenarios are considered: the SSP 1.2-6 scenario, with global warming limited to less than 2°C, and the SSP 3-7.0 where global warming can reach up to 4°C. Finally, these scenarios are compiled to estimate the future export of TOC from Fennoscandian peninsula into its coastal waters. 

The aim of the study is to test two distinct hypotheses: 1) that a space-for-time approach, using a spatial “snap-shot” to predict temporal changes, can produce good forecast results; and 2) that global warming, including increased runoff intensity, together with land-use changes, with increased standing biomass, is likely to exacerbate the ongoing browning of freshwaters and, subsequently, also coastal darkening.


# Methods

## Data preparation 

The main water chemistry dataset used in this study (training dataset) comprised the data from `r dim(fennoscandia)[1]` lakes sampled during the Northern European Lake Survey in 1995 [@Henriksen1998]. The TOC concentration in each lake, as well as the catchment polygons defined with a digital elevation model, were downloaded from the NOFA database. Nine explanatory parameters, describing each of the lake catchments, were compiled as predictor variables: NDVI; Forest, Arable and Bog; Runoff, Precip and Temp; TNdep and TSdep. These are shortly described below. The complete procedure for preparation, extraction, compilation, and sources of data is described in [Supplementary 1](https://camilmc.github.io/TOC_trend_1995/Supp1_nsf_model.html).

The test dataset, provided by the Norwegian Institute for Water Research, comprised 1001 lakes sampled in 2019 [@Hindar2020]. Each lake of the test dataset was matched with the corresponding lake of the training dataset, in order to use the same catchment polygons, from the NOFA database (see [Supplementary 2](https://camilmc.github.io/TOC_trend_1995/Supp2_NIVA_model.html)).

*	Total organic carbon (TOC) concentration in mg C/L (`r fig_nums("toc-map", display = "c")`) were extracted from the Northern European Lake Survey dataset from 1995 and from the 1000-lakes-survey in 2019. As the TOC concentration values were skewed, the data were log-transformed (logTOC) to normalize the distribution.

*	Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (`r fig_nums("insert-maps", display = "c")`a) averaged for the summer months (June, July, and August) were downloaded from the GIMMS database (The National Center for Atmospheric Research 2018) for 1994, i.e., the year preceding sampling. For the 2019 dataset, data from 2015 is used, as it was the latest available year in the GIMMS database. 

* Mean runoff intensity (Runoff) values in mm/y (`r fig_nums("insert-maps", display = "c")`b) were derived from the CORDEX historical model. The period 1970-2000 was used for the 1995 data, and the period 1985-2015 was used for the 2019 data [@CORDEXvERC; @Kreienkamp2012]. As the runoff intensities were skewed the data were log-transformed (logRunoff) to normalize the distribution.

* Mean annual precipitation (Precip) in mm/y (`r fig_nums("insert-maps", display = "c")`c) and temperature (Temp) in ºC (`r fig_nums("insert-maps", display = "c")`d) for the years 1970 to 2000 were downloaded from the WorldClim database [@WorldClim] to be used for the 1995 data. As the precipitation distribution was not normally distributed the data were log transformed (logPrecip). As these climate data were not retained in the final model, they were not downloaded for the 2019 data. 

* Proportions of peatland (Bog), arable land (Arable) and forested area (Forest) (`r fig_nums("insert-maps", display = "c")`e, f, and g, respectively) within each catchment are computed from the Corine Land Cover (CLC) database (Copernicus Land Monitoring Service n.d.), and correspond to the data of 2000, as land use data prior to this were not available. Several CLC categories were merged to create the three categories used in this study (see [Supplementary 1](https://camilmc.github.io/TOC_trend_1995/Supp1_nsf_model.html)). For the 2019 dataset, Corine Land Cover data for 2018 was used. Although distributions of the different land use are not normally distributed, they are not log-transformed due to many zeros in the data. Other transformations (square, square roots) did not contribute to normalizing the distribution.


*	Total reactive nitrogen deposition (TNdep) in mg N/m2 and total sulfur deposition (TSdep) data in ug S/m2 (`r fig_nums("insert-maps", display = "c")`h and i, respectively) were extracted from EMEP models as the sum of dry and wet deposition [@EMEP; @EMEP2012]. Data from 2000 was used as these were the earliest available data, resulting in a slight underestimation of TNdep and TSdep since deposition has decreased since the 90s. For the 2019 dataset, EMEP data from 2019 was used.

 
  



## Spatial TOC models

@Larsen2011b used a Multiple Linear regression model (LM) to predict the effect of climate change on the spatial distribution of TOC concentration in 1 000 Norwegian lakes. In the present study, including in addition almost 4 000 lakes in Sweden and Finland, a similar linear model is reproduced to investigate the explanatory value of the three predictors selected by Larsen et al., (i.e., NDVI, Bog and Runoff) along with other conceptually relevant predictors, for explaining the spatial differences in TOC levels in Fennoscandian lakes.


The spatial autocorrelation of all the predictors were determined by computing Moran’s I (see details in [Supplementary 4](https://camilmc.github.io/TOC_trend_1995/Supp4_effect_size.html)). All the assessed variables were found to be spatially autocorrelated. To take this into account, a Spatial Error Linear Model (SELM) was fitted with the same predictors as for the LM and the results compared. The Akaike Information Criteria was used to compare the performances of the models. 

The SELM and LM models are fitted on the 1995 data and slope estimates (i.e., slope $\beta$ as in the simple model $y\hspace{1pt}=\hspace{1pt}\beta x\hspace{1pt}+\hspace{1pt}c$) were evaluated both on scaled and unscaled variables. The scaled estimates (i.e., computed with centered and normalized variables) were used to compare the impact of the predictor variables on a standard deviation scale ($\beta$ expressing the relative impact of the predictor on the response variable), while the unscaled estimates were used to compute effect sizes (expressing how much will the response variable vary for a given change in the predictor). Equations used to calculate effect size for each pair of response/predictor variables are explained in [Supplementary 4](https://camilmc.github.io/TOC_trend_1995/Supp4_effect_size.html).


## Test of the Spatial Model on 1000-lakes-survey (2019) data

In 2019, a large survey covering 1 001 Norwegian lakes was conducted by the Norwegian Institute for Water Research [@Hindar2020]). The sampled lakes were basically the same as in 1995. More details on the 2019 data is available in [Supplementary 2](https://camilmc.github.io/TOC_trend_1995/Supp2_NIVA_model.html). The 2019 dataset of the 1 000 lakes survey was used to perform a real-size test of the space-for-time model. The model fitted on the Fennoscandic 1995 data was used to predict the TOC concentration value in the 1 001 lakes in 2019, and the results were compared with the actual observations. 

## Forecast of TOC prediction in coastal drainage basins

Changes in TOC concentrations in costal drainage basins by year 2100 are predicted using the verified SELM. Polygons representing the coastal drainage basins were used to cover the whole territory of Fennoscandia, and not only the studied lakes catchments. These basins are the ensemble of the watercourses that drains into the sea within a coastal section [@NVE]. The coastal drainage basins were defined using an elevation model delineated from a 10 m digital terrain model obtained from The Norwegian, Swedish and Finnish Mapping Authorities [@ninanor]. After cleaning, the dataset is composed of 1 392 watershed polygons (see [Supplementary 3](https://camilmc.github.io/TOC_trend_1995/Supp3_wr_model.html)).

Future changes in climate parameters are based on predicted changes in climate drivers derived from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (Phase 6) (CMIP6), run by the World Climate Research Program [@WCRP22] using two different SSPs [@Riahi2017]: SSP1-2.6 as the best scenario, assuming the average global warming will be limited to less than 2°C, and SSP 3-7.0 as our worst-case scenario [@Hausfather2019; @CORDEX2021]. Several institutions run the CMIP6 models to forecast future climate. Based on @Raju2020, the results from the model developed by the Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques (CRNM) were selected to extract future runoff intensity.

There is no forecast for NDVI in CMIP6. Summer NDVI values for 2050 and 2100 were instead predicted using a polynomial model based on forecast for temperature and precipitations in the period 2041-2060 and for the period 2081-2100. This model was fitted using summer months NDVI, temperature and precipitations in 1995. The predicted future temperature and precipitation values were extracted from the CRNM model. Modeled summer NDVI and changes in this NDVI in the future are shown in [Supplementary 3](https://camilmc.github.io/TOC_trend_1995/Supp3_wr_model.html).

TNdep is also not modelled for the future and depends on the selected SSP. Between 2000 and 2020 the TNdep decreased due to reduced emission of both reduced (NH3) and oxidized nitrogen (NOx) [@EEA2021]. Future trends in TNdep for the forecasts SSP 1-2.6 and SSP 3-7.0 were assessed based on the estimation for future N emissions described above. According to the Sixth Assessment of the IPCC report [@IPCC2019], the NOx emissions will decrease slightly for the SSP 1-2.6 (from 11 to 9 Mt/y) and increase for SSP 3-7.0 (from 11 to 21 Mt/y), between 1995 and 2100. There are no projections for reduced nitrogen, instead NH3 is assumed to decrease by around 20% between 2020 and 2100 in case of the SSP 1-2.6, and to remain constant for SSP 3-7.0.

## Selection of predictor variables

### Spatial distribution of predictors

Spatially distributed data of the mean values of summer NDVI, Runoff, Precip, Temp, Bog, Arable, Forest, TNdep and TSdep were assessed as possible predictor variables to be used in the SELM. Catchment means of these variables, describing each of the `r dim(fennoscandia)[1]` lake catchments in Fennoscandia, are shown in `r fig_nums("insert-maps", display = "c")`.


```{r insert-maps, fig.dim = c(30,36), fig.align = "center"}
listgrob <- list("map.ndvi.png","map.Runoff.png","map.Precip.png","map.temp.png","map.Bog.png","map.arable.png","map.forest.png","map.tndep.png", "map.tsdep.png") %>% lapply(readPNG) %>% lapply(rasterGrob)
#grid.arrange(grobs = listgrob, ncol = 3)
all.map <- plot_grid(plotlist = listgrob, ncol= 3, nrow = 3, align = "v", greedy = T, labels = c("a)","b)","c)","d)","e)","f)","g)","h)","i)"), label_size = 25)
save_plot("predictor.maps.png",all.map, ncol = 3, nrow = 3, base_height = 8, base_width = 6)
print(all.map)
```

<div align = 'center'>*`r fig_nums("insert-maps", "Maps of the predictor variables: NDVI (a), mean runoff intensity (Runoff, b), temperature (Temp, c), precipitation intensity (Precip, d), proportion of peat (Bog, e), proportion of forest (Forest, f), proportion of arable land (Arable, g), total nitrogen deposition (TNdep, h) and total sulfur deposition (TSdep, i) in the studied catchments")`*</div>

### Pearson Correlation coefficient, autocorrelation and Variance Inflation Factor

```{r p-I-VIF}
m <- c("logTOC","NDVI","logRunoff","logPrecip","Temp","Bog","Arable","Forest","TNdep","TSdep")
cor.mat <- cor(dplyr::select(fennoscandia,m[-1]))

lm.all <- lm(data = fennoscandia, formula = as.formula(paste(m[1],"~",paste(m[-1],collapse = "+"))))
lm.vif <- car::vif(lm.all) %>% as.data.frame() %>% setNames("VIF")

cor.toc <- apply(dplyr::select(fennoscandia,m[-1]),2,cor,fennoscandia$logTOC) %>% as.data.frame() %>% setNames("Cor.toc")

moran.df <- readRDS("moran.df.Rdata")

moran.limit <- 1/(dim(fennoscandia)[1]-1)

moran.vif.df <- merge(moran.df,lm.vif, by.x = "parameter", by.y = 0) %>% merge(cor.toc, by.x = "parameter", by.y = 0)
moran.vif.df[,2:5] <- round(moran.vif.df[,2:5],2)
moran.vif.df <- moran.vif.df[,-3]
```

Predictor variables that are strongly correlated (multi-collinear) reduce the robustness of multiple linear models and the precision of their estimates [@Vittinghoff2012]. This is disclosed by investigating the Pearson correlation coefficients (r) for each pair of variables, shown in `r table_nums("corrplot", display = "c")`. In addition, the Moran’s I of each variable was calculated (`r fig_nums("toc_map", display = "c")`), estimating the spatial autocorrelation for each variable. Considering the substantial number of observations, the maximum Moran’s I value for a non-autocorrelated variable would be `r format(moran.limit,scientific = T, digits = 2)`. All variables in this study had a Moran’s I above this limit, indicating a high degree of autocorrelation. Finally, the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), indicating the severity of multi-collinearity due to a single predictor, was computed, and presented in `r fig_nums("toc_map", display = "c")`.

The Pearson correlation coefficient matrix in `r table_nums("corrplot", display = "c")` highlights several groups of predictors that are strongly correlated. TNdep, TSdep and Temp are closely correlated, especially TNdep and TSdep with r = `r round(cor(fennoscandia$TNdep,fennoscandia$TSdep),2)`. The correlation coefficient between TNdep and Temp is `r round(cor(fennoscandia$Temp,fennoscandia$TNdep),2)`, and the correlation coefficient between TSdep and Temp is `r round(cor(fennoscandia$Temp,fennoscandia$TSdep),2)`. This is because both N and S deposition are mainly from long-range transported atmospheric pollution in Europe located to the south. The deposition of nitrate and sulfate is thus higher in the southern regions of Fennoscandia where also the temperature is higher. Additionally, the high correlation is also due to that both S and N deposition are based on emission inventories that are calculated using the same meteorological model. TSdep also has the highest VIF (`r round(lm.vif["TSdep",],2)`), followed by TNdep (`r round(lm.vif["TNdep",],2)`). Likewise, Temp, TNdep and TSdep have a remarkably high Moran’s I (all around 0.9), reflecting their similar spatial pattern. Because of the strong interaction between these three predictors, only one can be used in the model. Although the decrease in TSdep has been highlighted by several studies as the main driver for the temporal increase in TOC concentration [@Monteith2007], we chose instead to keep TNdep as a predictor for atmospheric deposition in this study. This is based on that TSdep is not conceived to change much in the future and that reactive N is biological relevant, being generally the limiting factor for terrestrial primary production. 

Forest and summer NDVI were also closely correlated (r = `r round(cor(fennoscandia$Forest,fennoscandia$NDVI),2)`) although they do not match as closely as could be inherently expected. Despite the finer resolution of the Corine Land Cover dataset for forest land cover, logTOC is slightly stronger correlated to summer NDVI (r = `r round(cor(fennoscandia$logTOC,fennoscandia$NDVI),2)`) than to Forest (r = `r round(cor(fennoscandia$logTOC,fennoscandia$Forest),2)`). Moreover, NDVI reflects the density of the vegetation, and thus likely represents a better indicator for total standing biomass. Likewise, summer NDVI better reflects the photosynthetic activity of plants by representing greenness. Finally, the VIF of summer NDVI was lower than that of Forest (`r round(lm.vif["NDVI",],2)` compared to `r round(lm.vif["Forest",],2)`), showing that it is less correlated to the other predictor variables. Therefore, only NDVI was kept as the vegetation biomass proxy in this study. 

LogRunoff and LogPrecip were also strongly positively correlated (r = `r round(cor(fennoscandia$Forest,fennoscandia$NDVI),2)`). LogPrecip had a higher VIF than logRunoff (`r round(lm.vif["logPrecip",],2)` compared to `r round(lm.vif["logRunoff",],2)`), showing more general correlation to the other predictors, but a lower Moran’s I (`r round(moran.df[which(moran.df$parameter == "logPrecip"),2])` for logPrecip, compared to `r round(moran.df[which(moran.df$parameter == "logRunoff"),2],2)` for logRunoff). Conceptually, surface runoff is a more relevant predictor for TOC export from catchment to surface waters than precipitation, as the part of the precipitation that evapotranspirates or infiltrates into ground reservoirs do not reach the surface water bodies. Moreover, logRunoff is stronger correlated to logTOC (r = `r round(cor(fennoscandia$logTOC,fennoscandia$logRunoff),2)`) than logPrecip (r = `r round(cor(fennoscandia$logTOC,fennoscandia$logPrecip),2)`). LogRunoff intensity was therefore selected as the preferred NOM transport related predictor in the model.


The proportions of Bog and Arable land were not strongly correlated to any other variable (`r table_nums("corrplot", display = "c")`), and both had low VIF and Moran’s I (`r fig_nums("toc_map", display = "c")`). Therefore, both were kept in the model as explanatory variables for TOC.


# Results and discussion 

## Modelling of TOC concentration on the Northern Lake Survey dataset

A multiple Linear Model (LM) and a multiple Spatial Error Linear Model (SELM) were fitted for the log of TOC on the 5 predictors selected in the previous section. The SELM takes into account the spatial autocorrelation of the predictor variables in the error term of the regression. To compare the two models, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was calculated. The AIC for each model is presented in [Supplementary 1](https://camilmc.github.io/TOC_trend_1995/Supp1_nsf_model.html).

Both models were fitted without and with scaled variables. This allows a comparison of scaled estimates with the actual effect size for each predictor variable (`r fig_nums("compare-plots-5", display = "c")`). Centered and scaled estimates (hereafter referred to as $\beta$), fitted on response and predictors variables, show the degree of contribution of each predictor to the response variable value, but not the extent of this impact on the real scale. The effect sizes are instead expressed as percent change in TOC concentration caused by a 1% relative change, as explained in [Supplementary 4](https://camilmc.github.io/TOC_trend_1995/Supp4_effect_size.html): 1% increase in summer NDVI (0.01 on the NDVI index); 0.01 increase in logRunoff (corresponding to 1% increase of the original runoff); 1% increase in either Forest, Bog or Arable land coverage proportion; and 25 µg/m2 increase of nitrogen deposition (1% of the range of TNdep). These relative changes of 1% are arbitrarily chosen to represent the relative impact of each predictor variable on a comparable basis. This means that a  $1 \%$ change of the predictor $x$, with an effect size $\delta x$ in catchment A with initial TOC concentration  $TOC_{A}$ would result in a final TOC concentration of $TOC_{A}+\delta x∗TOC_{A}$ where $TOC_{A}$.

Summer NDVI is the strongest predictor for logTOC in both LM and SELM. LM gives a higher impact to NDVI, with an estimate of `r round(s.lm.coef.5[which(s.lm.coef.5$Parameter == "s.NDVI"), which(names(s.lm.coef.5) == "Estimate")],2)` and an effect size of `r round(lm.effectsize.5[which(lm.effectsize.5$Parameter == "NDVI"), which(names(lm.effectsize.5) == "Percent")],2)`%, while SELM gave a scaled estimate of `r round(s.sem.coef.5[which(s.sem.coef.5$Parameter == "s.NDVI"), which(names(s.sem.coef.5) == "Estimate")],2)` and an effect size of `r round(sem.effectsize.5[which(sem.effectsize.5$Parameter == "NDVI"), which(names(sem.effectsize.5) == "Percent")],2)`% (`r fig_nums("compare-plots-5", display = "c")`).

LogRunoff had high scaled estimates, especially for the LM with $\beta =$ `r round(s.lm.coef.5[which(s.lm.coef.5$Parameter == "s.logRunoff"),which(names(s.lm.coef.5) == "Estimate")],2)`, while SELM had $\beta =$ `r round(s.sem.coef.5[which(s.sem.coef.5$Parameter == "s.NDVI"), which(names(s.sem.coef.5) == "Estimate")],2)`. The effect size of a 1% increase in logRunoff has a negative effect on the TOC concentration (`r round(lm.effectsize.5[which(lm.effectsize.5$Parameter == "logRunoff"), which(names(lm.effectsize.5) == "Percent")],2)`% for LM and `r round(sem.effectsize.5[which(sem.effectsize.5$Parameter == "logRunoff"), which(names(sem.effectsize.5) == "Percent")],2)`% for SELM) (`r fig_nums("compare-plots-5", display = "c")`). A plausible conceptual rationale for this negative effect is that the overall dilution effect is on average stronger than the increased episodic flushing of NOM. The spatial distribution of TOC concentration could also impact this result, as the highest runoff values are in the steep mountain areas in the west coast of Norway, where the soils are thin and the TOC concentrations are low.

Bog, despite its low correlation with logTOC (`r round(cor(fennoscandia$logTOC,fennoscandia$Bog),2)`), has relatively high scaled estimates (`r round(s.lm.coef.5[which(s.lm.coef.5$Parameter == "s.Bog"), which(names(s.lm.coef.5) == "Estimate")],2)` for LM and `r round(s.sem.coef.5[which(s.sem.coef.5$Parameter == "s.Bog"), which(names(s.sem.coef.5) == "Estimate")],2)` for SELM) and effect sizes (`r round(lm.effectsize.5[which(lm.effectsize.5$Parameter == "Bog"), which(names(lm.effectsize.5) == "Percent")],2)`% for LM and `r round(sem.effectsize.5[which(sem.effectsize.5$Parameter == "Bog"), which(names(sem.effectsize.5) == "Percent")],2)`% for SELM) (`r fig_nums("compare-plots-5", display = "c")`). This is confirming the role of bog coverage as an important spatial predictor for TOC concentration. Still, bogs evolves slowly, and their area-wise proportion is assumed to be constant over timescales relevant for our study. They can however experience short-term extreme events, such as droughts that are predicted to occur with increased frequency [@Helbig2020]. However, since we base our TOC forecast on 20-year averages of the main predictors (precipitation and temperature to predict NDVI, as well as runoff), the impact of extreme events on the TOC average is considered limited.

Arable land has negligible impact on TOC, along with a relatively low negative effect size (`r round(lm.effectsize.5[which(lm.effectsize.5$Parameter == "Arable"), which(names(lm.effectsize.5) == "Percent")],2)`% for LM and `r round(sem.effectsize.5[which(sem.effectsize.5$Parameter == "Arable"), which(names(sem.effectsize.5) == "Percent")],2)`% for SELM) (`r fig_nums("compare-plots-5", display = "c")`). Agricultural soils store indeed less carbon than forest soils and bogs [@FAO2020], though the use of phosphate fertilizers may affect the primary production and thus the levels of autochthonous NOM in lakes through eutrophication. This effect does however not appear to be a preponderant factor governing NOM levels in the studied region.

TNdep has positive impact on TOC concentration (r = `r round(cor(fennoscandia$logTOC,fennoscandia$TNdep),2)`), with both relatively high positive scaled estimates (`r round(s.lm.coef.5[which(s.lm.coef.5$Parameter == "s.TNdep"), which(names(s.lm.coef.5) == "Estimate")],2)` for LM and `r round(s.sem.coef.5[which(s.sem.coef.5$Parameter == "s.TNdep"), which(names(s.sem.coef.5) == "Estimate")],2)` for SELM) and effect sizes (`r round(lm.effectsize.5[which(lm.effectsize.5$Parameter == "TNdep"), which(names(lm.effectsize.5) == "Percent")],2)`% for LM and `r round(sem.effectsize.5[which(sem.effectsize.5$Parameter == "TNdep"), which(names(sem.effectsize.5) == "Percent")],2)`% for SELM) (`r fig_nums("compare-plots-5", display = "c")`). The positive effect of TNdep on TOC may on the one hand be  surprising as the deposition of acid rain, including the strongly correlated TSdep, is known to have a negative effect on TOC concentration in several studies [@Monteith2007]. The positive effect of TNdep may instead be due to a spatial co-variation, as the TNdep is higher in the southern and warmer part of Fennoscandia, where high summer NDVI, drive the high TOC concentrations. It can also be driven by the fertilizing effect of accumulating TNdep in the biomass. Future impact of reactive nitrogen deposition depends on public policies, as it is linked to combustion of fossil fuel and agricultural practices in central Europe. Here, the effect size is calculated for an increase of 25 µg/m2 of TNdep, though TNdep might either decrease in the coming decades (SSP 1-2.6) or remain stable (SSP 3-7.0).


The SELM model had a lower AIC (Aikaike Information Criteria) than the LM model (see [Supplementary 1](https://camilmc.github.io/TOC_trend_1995/Supp1_nsf_model.html)). It also resulted in estimates being less extreme than the LM. Especially, summer NDVI and Runoff have lower estimates and effect sizes with SELM than with LM. On the other hand, TNdep had higher estimate and effect size with SELM compared to LM. This shows that the SELM model is more balanced and less likely to over- or underestimate the impact of each predictor. Moran’s I of the residuals is higher for the LM than for the SELM, showing a stronger spatial pattern of the errors in LM. The SELM model performs therefore better in predicting the TOC concentration in boreal lakes and is assessed further in the next section.

<div align = 'center'>*`r fig_nums(name = "niva-test-result",caption = "Real-data test of the SELM model, a) TOC concentration (in mg C/L) in 1995 and in 2019, b) predicted vs. measured logTOC; c) map of the spatial distribution of the difference between measured and fitted logTOC.", display = "f")`*</div>

The results of the real-size test of the space-for-time model show that the SELM model fitted with data from 1995 of the five selected predictors gives satisfactory results, with a correlation coefficient between observed 2019 data and fitted logTOC of 0.84. However, the model tends to over-estimate the TOC concentration in lakes with a low initial TOC concentration, generally found in the mountains, and under-estimate the TOC concentration in lakes with high initial TOC concentration, particularly in the south-eastern part of Norway (`r fig_nums(name = "niva-test-result",display = "c")`b).

The space-for-time approach uses a set of explanatory values taken at a snap-shot moment in time from a large variety of catchment types to model future changes. The relationships between the explanatory parameters and the TOC response parameter at any single site is a result of biogeochemical processes that have developed in the soils since the last glacial epoch (i.e., about 15 000 years), e.g., the long-term processes of generating the pool of soil organic matter. That catchments in the middle of the Norwegian mountains are predicted to have a higher TOC concentration in 2019 compared to the actual observations (`r fig_nums(name = "niva-test-result",display = "c")`b) is hence likely due to a recent increased NDVI in these regions, not yet followed by the soil formation that a catchment with a similar NDVI value in 1995 would have had. Similarly, the TOC concentration of lakes in Southeast Norway are mostly under-estimated since in 1995, when the TOC was still suppressed by S-deposition: high TNdep, being strongly correlated to TSdep, would have meant low TOC concentration, while in 2019 the role of TNdep as a predictor is more related to the positive fertilizing effect of accumulating reactive N in the watersheds than the negative acid rain effect.

Having in mind these potential discrepancies, this space for time model can be used to obtain an indication of future TOC concentration under various climate scenarios, as the prediction range and the difference observed/predicted in this study nevertheless serves as a good indication in most catchments.

## Forescast with SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0

Future average TOC concentration were computed for `r dim(wr.sf.95)[1]` coastal drainage basins in Norway, Sweden and Finland. 

As each coastal drainage basins comprise several lakes and catchments, there is no empirical data for their respective average TOC concentration in their various water bodies. Therefore, the first step was to compute the TOC concentration in 1995 using the SELM fitted and verified in the above section. In a second step, the forecast of the predictor variables Temp, Precip and Runoff were extracted from CMIP6 climate models based on two distinct scenarios: SSP1-2.6 (global warming limited to less than 2°C) and SSP 3-7.0 (global warming up to 4°C). Summer NDVI was then modelled based on Precip and Temp (see [Supplementary 3](https://camilmc.github.io/TOC_trend_1995/Supp3_wr_model.html)) using a polynomial model, as described in [@Larsen2011b].

Future trends in TNdep were assessed based on estimations from IPCC as described above. According to their predictions following the SSP1-2.6 there will be a net decrease in TNdep through 2050 to 2100 and a net increase in the SSP 3-7.0 forecast. Finally, the average TOC concentration was simulated for two time periods: 2041-2060 and 2081-2100 (abbreviated as “2050” and “2100”). The details of predictor extraction and model fitting are presented in [Supplementary 3](https://camilmc.github.io/TOC_trend_1995/Supp3_wr_model.html).

`r fig_nums("ssp-toc",display = "c")` shows the difference between logTOC in 2050 and 2100, fitted for the different climate scenarios, relative to logTOC fitted for the coastal drainage basins based on the 1995 data. The over- or under-estimation of TOC concentration, identified by the test on 2019-data, is assumed to be partially compensated by this double-fit. Moreover, the TOC is forecasted as an average over a 20-years period, which likely serves to limit the “snap-shot” effect by considering a certain adaptation time of the system, although it does not account for centennial processes.

print(ssp)
```

<div align = 'center'>*`r fig_nums("ssp-toc","Forecast of changes in logTOC concentration (mg C/L) under SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0 climate scenarios. ")`*</div>

The forecasts of changes in average TOC concentration show an increase in most of Fennoscandia under both climate scenarios, with a stronger increase in the south-east of Sweden and south-west of Finland. The pattern of change is similar for SSP1-2.6 and for SSP3-7.0, with the latter representing more extreme changes. 

The modelled changes of TOC are basically driven by the forecasted changes in NDVI (see [Supplementary 3](https://camilmc.github.io/TOC_trend_1995/Supp3_wr_model.html)), reflecting the expected changes in biomass, which is mainly propelled by the temperature increase. A main effect of this increase is the longer growing seasons and therefore a higher biomass production in forests, along with a higher biodegradation rate of organic matter in soils. This increase in growth is supported by sustained amount of precipitation in most of Fennoscandia, if not an increase for the Norwegian West Coast. This limits the potential for soil dryness and water stress, even though the water lost by evapotranspiration will increase [@Gauthier2015; @DOrangeville2018]. In this space-for-time approach, the chain of processes between biomass production and carbon storage in forest soils are not integrated, so there will be a delay before the export of TOC from soils to surface exports starts to increase as well. Nevertheless, these results can be used as a good trend indicator. It is worth noting that, in this model, the northern coastal drainage basins are not strongly affected despite a stronger increase in temperature (up to 10 degrees). This might be due to an underestimation of the increase in summer NDVI in these regions (see [Supplementary 3](https://camilmc.github.io/TOC_trend_1995/Supp3_wr_model.html)). Also, the effect of thawing permafrost is not accounted for in this study [@Abbott2014a]. Moreover, these changes in NDVI do not account for the forest policies implemented by Norway, Sweden, and Finland to capture and sequester CO2 to fulfill their Paris agreement obligations [@Vogt2022]. The specific relationship between forest proportion and TOC concentration is studied in [Supplementary 5](https://camilmc.github.io/TOC_trend_1995/Supp5_forest_impact.html). Nonetheless, an increase in forest cover would lead to an increase of NDVI, so these results are an indication of the impact of an increased catchment biomass on TOC concentration.


Forecasted trends in runoff intensity resemble changes in summer NDVI patterns and match the TOC concentration evolution in the same manner. The regions with higher runoff (Norwegian mountains, and some basins in northern Sweden) will, due to increased dilution, experience slightly less increase in TOC concentration than the regions with decreasing runoff (southern Sweden and Finland). A strong decrease of Runoff was modelled in small coastal drainage basins on the Norwegian western coast. This is likely caused by  poor performances of the runoff model in this region due to its steep topography. Still, this has a limited impact on the TOC forecast. In both SSP scenarios, the TOC concentrations in the western basins are forecasted to increase, but far less than in the southern regions in Sweden where the forecasts of runoff show a slight decrease. Our model does not consider the seasonal patterns of runoff, which will be more impacted by climate change than the average yearly runoff [@Hanssen-Bauer2017]. Summer runoff will decrease in most regions, due to earlier snowmelt and more evapotranspiration, while winter runoff is predicted to increase in most regions. These changes may have antagonistic effects: mobilization of soil organic carbon will increase during the winter and spring [@Haland2017], while increased residence time of the TOC in lakes will allow for more enhanced photo- and biodegradation of the NOM during the summer, leading to lower concentrations. Whether higher fluxes and mineralization rate lead to a net higher or lower NOM concentration in surface water is subject to discussion [@DeWit2016a]. The SELM shows that the dilution effect (i.e., more runoff means more surface water and less residence time) prevails over the mobilization effect, though this requires more investigation.


Finally, accumulation of reactive nitrogen from TNdep in southern Norway and the south-western part of Sweden is also affecting the future predicted levels of TOC. In these regions the NDVI is forecasted to increase, but this is not accompanied in the model by a corresponding increase in TOC concentration. As TNdep is projected to decrease significantly under SSP1-2.6 scenario, the predicted TOC increase in these regions is limited. On the contrary, under SSP3-7.0 2100, there is no significant change in the rate of TNdep in 2100 compared to 1995. This is thus not hampering the decomposition of soil organic matter, allowing for an increase of TOC. This interpretation assumes that the chronic TNdep has a positive effect on TOC concentration by that TNdep limit microbial respiration and root activities in soils, reducing soil organic matter  mineralization rates and thus increasing the pool of TOC readily exportable to surface water [@Bowden2004; @Ramirez2012; @Janssens2010]. However, this modelled effect  is more likely a consequence of the inherent weakness in the space-for-time approach as it likely reflects the spatial location of TOC-rich surface waters rather than a potential fertilization effect of TNdep. As the highest TOC concentrations are found in south-east Sweden, while the regions most affected by TNdep are south-east Norway and south-west Sweden, we can nonetheless assume that the effects of TNdep observed in our models are related to the removal of N-limitation of the forest. In this study, the projected changes of TNdep in the future were roughly estimated and depend largely on regulations concerning fossil fuels burning and agricultural practices. A finer evaluation of the potential evolution of public policies would be necessary to refine the contribution of future TNdep to TOC concentration in surface waters.


## Coastal darkening

Modelling TOC concentration in coastal drainage basins provides an estimate of future TOC export to the Baltic Sea and the Norwegian coast from Fennoscandia. Most coastal drainage basins in Sweden and Finland drain into to the Baltic Sea (see [Supplementary 2](https://camilmc.github.io/TOC_trend_1995/Supp2_NIVA_model.html)), while Norwegian coastal basins drain to Skagerrak, the North Sea, the Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea [@Saetre2007]. All contribute to the Norwegian coastal current freshwater: 50% comes from the Baltic Sea, and 40% from Norway. The estimated exported TOC from each coastal drainage basin was computed as:

$$ TOC_{exp} = [TOC]\hspace{1pt}(mg.L^{-1}) \times Runoff\hspace{1pt}(mm.y{-1}) \times Watershed\hspace{1pt}area\hspace{1pt}(m^2)$$

Past and future TOC concentrations ($mgC.L^{-1}$) were obtained by taking the antilog of logTOC. The result of the above equation, giving the amount of TOC exported in $mg.y^{-1}$, is then converted to $Tg$. Forecasts are presented in `r fig_nums("coastal-darkening",display = "c")`.

```{r future-darkening, fig.dim = c(12,18)}

<div align = 'center'>*`r fig_nums("coastal-darkening","Forecast of TOC export to coastal waters under SSP 1-2.6 and SSP 3.7-0 (Tg); above: absolute export, below: relative export compared to 1995.")`*</div>

Under the SSP 1-2.6 scenario, the export of TOC into the NCC will increase by 5 Tg by 2050 compared to 1995, and by 8 Tg in 2100. Under the SSP 3-7.0 scenario, the total TOC import into the NCC will first increase by 7 Tg in the forecast for 2041-2060, and by 17,5 Tg for the period 2081-2100. Swedish coastal drainage basins would contribute the most to these increases. Associated with higher surface temperature, this browning of coastal water could lead to later spring bloom and spawning time. 

# Conclusion

This study demonstrates the relevance of using space-for-time models in order to forecast future regional environmental changes in TOC concentration in freshwater. The TOC concentration was best predicted by a spatial error linear model, with catchment characteristics as predictors. Long-term processes working on the catchment characteristics are not taken into account in the space-for-time approach. Nevertheless, the simulated changes from 1995 to 2019 were in good agreement with measured values (r = 0.84). NDVI, being a good proxy for the amount of biomass in the catchment, is a major predictor for TOC concentration. Runoff intensity was also a significant predictor with a negative effect on TOC concentration. The proportion of bogs on the catchment was also a good spatial predictor for TOC concentration in lakes, while the proportion of arable land had almost no effect. Finally, atmospheric deposition of nitrogen has significant positive effects on the TOC concentration in lakes. 

The forecast of TOC changes within this century indicate an increase of total TOC export from Fennoscandia in the SSP1-2.6 scenario (+7.9 Tg in 2100) and an even stronger increase in the SSP3-7.0 scenario (+17.5 Tg). Under the SSP1-2.6 scenario, antagonistic effects of changes in predictors outweigh each other in several of the coastal drainage basins. In particular, the decrease of nitrogen deposition compensates the increase in biomass in southern Norway, limiting the increase of TOC amount in freshwater.
