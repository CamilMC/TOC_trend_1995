# Introduction 

In Nordic boreal lakes, increased flux of natural organic matter from catchments to rivers and lakes has resulted in a widespread darkening of freshwater, a phenomenon referred to as browning. This trend has been documented since the 80 @Monteith2007, when several monitoring programs were implemented to document the effect of acid deposition abatement policies. The two successive sulphur protocols of Helsinki in 1985 and in Oslo 1994 @UNECE were followed by regional synoptic surveys on water quality, one in 1986  @Henriksen1989 and one in 1995 (Northern European Lake Survey @Henriksen1998). The former covered 1 000 lakes in Norway, while the latter survey included also almost 4 000 lakes in Sweden, Finland, Denmark, as well as Scotland, Wales and Russian Kola and Karelia. A 50% decrease of acid rains was observed between the period 76-85 and the period 95-2001 @Menz2004. Since then the SO2 levels in European air has declined further by 74%, and the sulphate in dry and wet deposition decreased by 61 and 60%, respectively @Fagerli2019.  This has led to that the regional median values of sulphate in lakes have decreased by 41 and 61% in Northern and southern parts of Norway, Sweden, and Finland, respectively, between the period 2012-2016 to 1990-1994  @Garmo2020. Finstad et al. @Finstad2016 demonstrated that this reduced sulphate load has increased the solubility of dissolved organic matter (DOM), thereby increasing the concentration of organic matter in surface waters. @DeWit2007a. 

However, also other environmental factors are important in governing the brownification of the surface waters. A main pressure is climate change, with especially changing runoff patterns, expected to lead to an increased flushing of DOM to surface waters. @DeWit2016a. Longer growing seasons increase the primary production and thereby the biomass in the catchments @Finstad2016. In addition, there are land-use changes that tend towards more and more intensive forestry practices. Small-scale farming used out-field resources as grazing pastures for their husbandry @Myrstener2021. The abandonment of these practices has resulted in increased standing forest biomass. Finstad et al.5, modelling the increase of DOM concentrations in 70 Norwegian lakes over 30 years, found that the increase in terrestrial biomass (using Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as its proxy) along with increasing temperature were significant drivers of freshwater DOM concentration.

Forest management is an essential tool in achieving the commitments in the Fennoscandian climate policies. @Sundnes2020 In line with the Declaration on Forest and Land Use signed on November 2021 @UNClimateChangeConferenceUK2021, the Fennoscandian governments consider forest as a leverage for offsetting their carbon emissions and reaching their zero-emission goals. @NordicCouncilofMinisters2021  With 43,5, 65,5 and 70,9% @OECD2020, respectively, of their territories covered with forest, Norway, Sweden and Finland are not subject to deforestation.  On the contrary, the boreal forest covering Fennoscandia is part of the largest organic carbon pool on Earth. According to Bradshaw et al. @Bradshaw2015, the mean value of the total organic carbon store in the boreal biome is about 1041,5 Pg, compared to 500 in the tropical forests. This carbon is mainly stored in soils, such as in peatlands. During the last centuries, a growth of boreal forests has been a net sink for CO2 . The increase in biomass is mainly because the forests benefited from a milder climate, with longer growing seasons, as well as the accumulation of reactive nitrogen from long-range transported air pollution. This enhanced growing rate partially compensated the CO2 emissions generated by deforestation in other parts of the world. @LeNoe2021. Current policies in the Nordics promote the intensification of the forest industry. In Norway, the ministry of Environment (Miljødirektoratet) subsidies densification of the planted areas and the afforestation of new so-called Climate forests   @Miljodirektoratet2013. In Sweden and Finland, where most of the forest area is productive, timber industry is a major economical resource. @RoyalSwedish2015 Forestry products account for 23% of the swedish total exports and the standing biomass doubled over the last 100 years @Narin. Formas, the Swedish government research council for sustainable development, promotes bioeconomy as a major climate mitigation tool. @Formas2012.Similarly, in Finland the national subsidy schemes aim at intensifying the forestry sector. A fifth of the Finnish export of goods come from the wood industry. @Forestry2014.  The Finnish forest legislation was renewed in the 2010s to improve its competitiveness while conserving its goals in terms of sustainability.

The planned intensification of forest management and afforestation has, on the other hand, raised concern regarding the water quality @NorskVann In Norway, 90% of the raw water used for drinking water comes from surface waters. @EnergifaktaNorge2020  . Browning has potential impact on the required raw water treatment to ensure potability of water.@Eikebrokk2018 In addition, brownification has impacts  on the local ecosystems and leads to increased greenhouse gases emissions from the lakes, especially in small lakes.@DeWit2018. 90% of the total organic matter in boreal lakes is dissolved (i.e., DOM) @Larsen2011 and has several key roles in the lake ecosystem. DOM is the main source of food and energy for heterotrophic bacteria. With darker waters, the light available for photosynthesis decreases, favouring heterotrophic bacteria above autotrophic bacteria, shifting the gas balance from a sink to a source of greenhouse gases  @Tranvik2009. In addition, the sunlight is absorbed by the coloured DOM, warming the upper layer of the lakes and causing prolonged stratification. Moreover, warm and dark water, with limited light availability, potentially disturb local species and fish production @Karlsson2009 @Craig2017. The current browning of freshwater lakes and rivers also entails the darkening of coastal waters, delaying phytoplankton spring blooms and decreasing primary production @Opdal2019a. Understanding the governing factors for DOM concentration under local anthropogenic and regional climatic stresses is therefore essential to forecast potential damages to the water quality and ecosystem services.

Larsen et al @Larsen2011a al28 developed in 2011 an empirical model for predicting the spatial variation of TOC concentrations (as a proxy for DOM) in the 1 000 Norwegian lakes of the 1995 Northern European Lake Survey. @Henriksen1998 The model was based on the lakes catchment characteristics, using catchment NDVI (Normalized Differential Vegetation Index), area fractions of bogs and area specific runoff as predictors. The current study expands on the DOM model basis by including almost 4 000 lakes and catchments from Sweden and Finland. 

To test the assumption that NDVI, %bogs and relative runoff are the main explanatory predictors for DOM additional catchment characteristics are initially included in the model. Furthermore, spatial error linear model and a geographically weighted model are used as spatial modelling tools to account for the spatial autocorrelation between the response and predictor variables. Based on the fitted model, the effect size (i.e., magnitude of effect) of a relative increase of each of the predictor variables are estimated. Finally, the fitted models are used to predict the runoff on DOM from the entire area of Fennoscandia by forecasting future average TOC concentration in the ensemble of Fenno-Scandinavian catchment water regions draining into the sea. These models allow us to test two hypotheses: 1) That climate change, with increased temperature and runoff, will increase the DOM concentration in Fennoscandian lake; and 2) That the climate forest policy is likely to exacerbate the ongoing brownification.


# Methods

## Data preparation 

The dataset comprised the `r dim(fennoscandia)[1]` lakes sampled during the Northern Lake Survey in 1995 @Henriksen1998. The TOC concentration is used as a proxy for the response variable DOM. @Henriksen1997. Eight explanatory parameters, describing each of the 4 736 catchments, were compiled as predictor variables (i.e., NDVI, proportion of forest (Forest), arable land (Arable) and peat (Bog), mean runoff intensity (Runoff), precipitation intensity (Precip) and temperature (Temp), total nitrogen (TN-dep)). These descriptors were computed as mean values of each parameter over the catchment (`r fig_nums("insert-maps", display = "c")`). The complete procedure for extraction, compilation and preparation of historic data is available in Supplementary 1. Here a short summary is presented. All logarithmic transformations use the natural logarithm.

* The total organic carbon (TOC) concentration (`r fig_nums("insert-maps", display = "c")`a) is a proxy for DOM. The data were extracted from the Northern Lake Survey dataset from 1995 , with the denomination mg C/L. As the TOC concentration values were skewed the data were log-transformed (log TOC) to normalize the distribution.

* Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values (`r fig_nums("insert-maps", display = "c")`b) for the summer months (June, July and August) are used a proxy for the amount of biomass. They were downloaded from the GIMMS database and averaged  for 1994. I.e., the year preceding sampling. @TheNationalCenterforAtmosphericResearch2018. 

* Mean runoff (Runoff) values as L/m2/s (i.e., mm/s) were derived from the CORDEX model for the period 1960 to 199031 @CORDEX @Kreienkamp2012. As the runoff intensities were skewed the data were log-transformed (log Runoff) to normalize the distribution (`r fig_nums("insert-maps", display = "c")`c). 

* Mean temperature (Temp) in degrees of centigrade (ºC) (`r fig_nums("insert-maps", display = "c")`d) and precipitation (Precip) in mm/year for the years 1970 to 2000 in each catchment were downloaded from the WorldClim database. @WorldClim. As the precipitation distribution was not normally distributed the data were log transformed (log Precip) (`r fig_nums("insert-maps", display = "c")`e).

*	Proportions of bogs (`r fig_nums("insert-maps", display = "c")`f), forested area (`r fig_nums("insert-maps", display = "c")`g) and arable land (`r fig_nums("insert-maps", display = "c")`h) within each catchment are computed from the Corine Land Cover (CLC) database @CopernicusCLC,and correspond to the 2000 data, as land use data prior to this were not available. Several CLC categories were merged to create the three categories used in this study (see Supplementary 1). Although distributions of the different land use are not normally distributed they are not log transformed due to many zeros in the data. Other possible transformations (square, square roots) did not contribute to normalize the distribution. 

*	Total nitrogen deposition (TN-dep) data (sum of dry and wet deposition; `r fig_nums("insert-maps", display = "c")`i) were extracted from EMEP models.@EMEP. Data from 2000 were used as this were the first available data.


Future changes in climate parameters are based on predicted changes in climate drivers derived from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (Phase 6) (CMIP6), run by the World Climate Research Program @WRCP22 using two different socio-economic pathways: @Riahi2017 SSP1-2.6 as the best scenario, assuming the global warming will be limited to less than 2°C, and SSP 3-7.0 as the realistic worst-case scenario. @Hausfather2019 @CORDEX2021.Several institutions run the CMIP6 models to forecast future climate. Based on a review conducted by Raju et al., @Raju2020, the results from the model developed by the CRNM (Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques) were used to extract future runoff, temperature, and precipitation values.


## Spatial DOM models

Larsen et al. @Larsen2011 used a multiple linear regression model (LM) to predict the effect of climate change on the TOC concentration in 1 000 Norwegian lakes. In this study, including almost 4 000 lakes in Sweden and Finland, a similar LM is reproduced, confirming that biomass (measured as NDVI), %bog coverage (Bog), and log of runoff intensity (log Runoff) are the main explanatory factors for the spatial differences in DOM levels in Norway, Sweden, and Finland. The spatial autocorrelation of the response (TOC) and predictor variables (NDVI, Bog and Runoff) are then accounted for by fitting a Spatial Error Linear Model (SELM) and a Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model. The SELM includes the spatial autocorrelation in the error term, while the GWR model computes a model for each individual datapoint.

The LM and SELM models are fitted both on scaled and unscaled variables. The scaled estimates (i.e., slope “a” as in the simple model $y = ax+b$) are used to compare the impact of the predictor variables on the same scale, while the unscaled estimates are used to estimate the effect sizes. The GWR model is fitted only with unscaled variables, as only the local effect sizes are assessed. The equations used to calculate the effect size for each pair response/predictor variable are explained in Supplementary 2. The GWR model computes a linear regression giving a stronger weight to the closest adjacent lakes. The considered neighbours are chosen to be the 500 nearest surrounding lakes, where weight for each lake is attributed following a gaussian distribution decline.

Future changes in DOM concentrations are forecasted using the fitted spatial error linear models based on main predictors. Future runoff scenarios of TOC are predicted based on predicted changes in future surface runoff. Future NDVI is modelled based on temperature and precipitation derived from CRNM, since no forecast exist for this index. The proportion of bogs is not expected to change, therefore no changes are made regarding their future evolution.

Polygons representing the water regions, were used to cover the whole territory of Fennoscandia, rather than only the catchments of the lakes included in the Northern Lake Survey. Water regions are the ensemble of the watercourse that drain to the sea within a coastal section.@NVE The water regions were computed from an elevation model (ref Anders). After cleaning, the dataset consisted of 1 392 polygons (see Supplementary 3).

## Overview of variables {#overview}

### Mapping of predictor and response variable

Eight explanatory parameters, describing each of the `r dim(fennoscandia)[1]` catchments as predictor variables, were computed as mean values of each parameter over the catchment (`r fig_nums("insert-maps", display = "c")`) I.e., NDVI, proportion of forest (Forest), arable land (Arable) and peat (Bog), mean runoff intensity (Runoff), precipitation intensity (Precip) and temperature (Temp), total nitrogen (TN-dep).

                     name = paste(u[grep(i,m)],"\n(",i,")",sep=""))+

    theme(legend.position = "bottom")
  filename_i <- paste("map",i,"png",sep = ".")
  ggsave(plot = map, filename = filename_i, dpi = "retina", width = 6, height = 8, units = "cm")
}
```

```{r insert-maps, fig.dim = c(6,9)}
knitr::include_graphics(c("map.TOC.png","map.ndvi.png","map.Runoff.png","map.Precip.png","map.temp.png","map.Bog.png","map.arable.png","map.forest.png","map.tndep.png"))
```

`r fig_nums("insert-maps", "Maps of DOM (TOC, a) and its predictor variables : Biomass (NDVI, b), mean runoff intensity (Runoff, c), temperature (Temp, d), precipitation intensity (Precip, e), peat (Bog, f), proportion of forest (Forest, c), and arable land (Arable, d), and total nitrogen deposition (TN-dep, i) in the studied catchments")`

### Correlations between predictor variables

`r table_nums("corrplot", "Correlation plot for predictor variables")`

```{r corrplot, fig.dim=c(4,4)}
m <- c("logTOC","NDVI","logRunoff","logPrecip","Temp","Bog","Arable","Forest","TNdep")
cor.mat <- cor(dplyr::select(fennoscandia,m[-1]))
corrplot::corrplot(cor.mat, method = "number",type = "lower", number.cex = 0.7, tl.cex = 0.7, cl.cex = 0.7)
```

Pearson correlation coefficients between the eight predictor variables are given in `r table_nums("corrplot", display = "c")`. All correlations are represented , regardless of their p-value. The highest Pearson correlation coefficient (r) is between TN-dep and Temp (r = `r round(cor(fennoscandia$Temp,fennoscandia$TNdep),2)`). This is due to that the N-deposition is highest in the warmer southern regions of Fennoscandia. Inherently, log Precip and log Runoff are correlated (r = `r round(cor(fennoscandia$logPrecip,fennoscandia$logRunoff),2)`). ), though runoff is expected to be a stronger predictor for DOM as it reflects more directly the potential variation in soil water flow-paths carrying DOM from soil to lakes. Log Precip and log Runoff can have both positive and negative effects on DOM concentration. In watersheds dominated by shallow soils, rock outcrop and peats (e.g., west coast of Norway), increased precipitation and runoff leads to an overall dilution of the DOM concentration in surface waters. On the other hand, in areas with till soil, the predominant water flow-path during wet periods is through the organic rich forest floor, flushing large amounts of DOM directly into the surface waters . @Vogt1990 During winter, a high amount of precipitation generates a deep snow layer that limits vegetation growth and thereby reduce the DOM production in the catchment. 

NDVI (`r fig_nums("rawndvi", display = "c")`) has as expected a strong positive correlation with % forest cover (`r fig_nums("rawclc", display = "c")`) (r = 0.58) (Table 1), although the two parameters do not provide the same information. NDVI does not distinguish between different types of vegetation, as it only reflects vegetation amount and density, which on the other hand is not accounted for in the land cover. Land cover data has a finer resolution than NDVI data. The minimum mapping unit in Corine Land Cover is 25 ha, for a minimum of 100 m linear feature, while NDVI has a much coarser resolution of 16 000 ha (8 km2). Moreover, the national mappings are based on satellite images that are interpreted in a semi-automatic manner, which results in slight deviations between countries. Finland and Sweden, for example, use two different methods to identify the forest cover.36 On the contrary, the NDVI is uniformly processed regardless of demographic regions. There are thus advantages and disadvantages regarding the use of NDVI and Forest cover. NDVI takes more into account the variations in amount of vegetation than type of vegetation, and thus more directly relevant to the production of DOM, while forest cover can be used to evaluate the impact of afforestation on the levels of DOM caused both response to climate change and forest management.

```{r rawndvi, fig.dim = c(3,5)}

```

knitr::include_graphics("Corine_Land_Cover/map-clc2.png")
```

`r fig_nums("rawclc", "Map of CORINE Land Cover (2000) in Norway, Sweden and Finland")`

### Spatial autocorrelation & VIF

Spatial autocorrelation and collinearity between the eight predictor variables in `r table_nums("corrplot", display = "c")` are evaluated using the Moran’s I index and the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), respectively. The results are presented in `r table_nums("moran-vif-table", display = "c")`.


```{r neighbour-matrix,  eval = F}
library(spdep)
k.neigh.set <- knearneigh(fennoscandia.spdf, k = 100)
k.neigh.nb.set <- knn2nb(k.neigh.set)
k.neigh.w <- nb2listw(k.neigh.nb.set)
saveRDS(k.neigh.w,"k.neigh.w.Rdata")
```

```{r spatial-autocorrelation, eval = T}
k.neigh.w <- readRDS("k.neigh.w.Rdata")
moran.list <- c() 

m <- c("logTOC","NDVI","logRunoff","logPrecip","Temp","Bog","Arable","Forest","TNdep")

for (i in m){
  moran.list[[i]] <- moran.test(fennoscandia[,i],k.neigh.w, na.action = na.omit, alternative = "two.sided")
}

moran.df <- data.frame(m) %>% setNames("parameter")
moran.df$moran.I <- NA
moran.df$p.value <- NA

for (i in 1:length(moran.list)){
  moran.df$moran.I[i] <- moran.list[[i]]$estimate[1]
  moran.df$p.value[i] <- moran.list[[i]]$p.value
}

saveRDS(moran.df,"moran.df.Rdata")
```

```{r vif}
lm.all <- lm(data = fennoscandia, formula = as.formula(paste(m[1],"~",paste(m[-1],collapse = "+"))))
lm.vif <- car::vif(lm.all) %>% as.data.frame() %>% setNames("VIF")
```


```{r moran-vif-table}
moran.df <- readRDS("moran.df.Rdata")

moran.limit <- 1/(dim(fennoscandia)[1]-1)

moran.vif.df <- merge(moran.df,lm.vif, by.x = "parameter", by.y = 0)
moran.vif.df[,2:4] <- round(moran.vif.df[,2:4],2)

moran.vif.df[,-3] %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(
    VIF = cell_spec(VIF,color = ifelse(VIF > 3,"red", "black"), bold = ifelse(VIF > 5, T, F)),
    moran.I = cell_spec(moran.I,bold = ifelse(moran.I > moran.limit, T, F),color = ifelse(moran.I > 0.8, "red","black"))) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2, 
    caption = table_nums("moran-vif-table",paste("Moran's I AND Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) of predictor and predictor variable (Moran's I limit = ", format(moran.limit,scientific = T, digits = 2),")",sep = "")),
    label = NA,
    escape = F,
    col.names = c("Predictor","Moran's I","VIF")) %>%    
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered", position = "center")
        
```

The most spatial auto-correlated variables according to Moran’s I test (temperature, log of precipitation, and total N deposition) have also the highest VIF (`r table_nums("moran-vif-table", display = "c")`). Temperature has a VIF above 5 (VIF = `r round(lm.vif["Temp",],2)`) and was strongly correlated to TN-deposition (`r table_nums("corrplot", display = "c")`), as well as with NDVI and Forest. The high VIF value (VIF = `r round(lm.vif["logPrecip",],2)`) of log of precipitation is mainly due to its inherent strong correlation with log of runoff intensity. TN-deposition was not strongly correlated with the other explanatory variables, so it was included in the model although it has a high VIF value. However, temperature and log of precipitation were excluded.  



## Comparison of linear model and spatial error model 

Using the six selected predictor variables in [section 3.1]{#overview} A linear model (LM) and a Spatial Error Model (SELM) were fitted for the logTOC against the selected predictor variables. The Spatial Error Model takes into account the spatial autocorrelation of the predictor variables in the error term of the regression. To compare the two models, the Akaike Information Criterion was calculated.

Both models were fitted with and without scaled variables. The effect size calculated using the raw (non-scaled) coefficients according to the method explained in Supplementary 2. A comparison of the regression coefficients and effect size for each predictor variables is shown on `r fig_nums("compare-plots-1", display = "c")`.

The effect sizes are expressed as % change in TOC concentration caused by a 10% increase in NDVI (0.1 on the NDVI index), runoff, bog and forest coverage and arable land (proportion increase of 0.1), and a 100 ug/m2  increase of nitrogen deposition (), respectively. These relative changes are arbitrarily chosen to represent the impact of each predictor variable on a comparable basis.

The scaled and effect size estimates are positive for an increase in NDVI, Bogs, Forest, Arable land and TN-dep, while the response is negative for an increase in log Runoff (`r fig_nums("compare-plots-1", display = "c")`). The SELM, having lower AIC (relative model fit) and Moran’s I (spatial autocorrelation), performs better than the LM, both with scaled and with unscaled variables. The estimates values by the two models are similar, though the LM tends to give higher values than the SELM. 

NDVI and log Runoff have the highest scaled response estimates (`r fig_nums("compare-plots-1", display = "c")`), with a significant difference between the LM and SELM. For these two parameters, the spatial lagged SELM provides lower response estimates, suggesting that using a LM over a varied region may over-estimate the impact of these parameters. Log Runoff has high scaled estimates but the effect size is low compared to the other parameters (`r round(s.lm.coef[which(s.lm.coef$Parameter == "s.logRunoff"), which(names(s.lm.coef) == "Estimate")],2)`% for LM and `r round(s.sem.coef[which(s.sem.coef$Parameter == "s.logRunoff"), which(names(s.sem.coef) == "Estimate")],2)`% for SELM).

Proportion of Bogs, Forest, and TN-dep have similar scaled estimate between 0,15 and 0,21, though their effect size differ significantly (`r fig_nums("compare-plots-1", display = "c")`). An 10% increase in the proportion of bog coverage would have a major impact, though this is  an unrealistic change, except in the case of local peat restoration project. A more realistic 10% increase in forest cover  will have a relative more limited though still clearly significant impact on the TOC: `r round(lm.effectsize[which(lm.effectsize$Parameter == "Forest"), which(names(lm.effectsize) == "Percent")],2)`% by LM and `r round(sem.effectsize[which(sem.effectsize$Parameter == "Forest"), which(names(sem.effectsize) == "Percent")],2)`% for SELM. TN-dep has the lowest effect size with about a `r round(sem.effectsize[which(sem.effectsize$Parameter == "TNdep"), which(names(sem.effectsize) == "Percent")],2)` % increase in TOC due to a 100 ug/m2 increase in reactive N loading. Although the annual Total N-deposition from long-range transported air pollution slowly decreases, the amount of reactive N continues to accumulate in these boral watersheds. Moreover, the use of Nitrogen fertilizers to increase forest production will serve to sustain  high N-saturation levels. 

A 10% increase in the proportion of arable land has a low scaled estimate (`r round(s.lm.coef[which(s.lm.coef$Parameter == "Arable"), which(names(s.lm.coef) == "Percent")],2)`) by LM and `r round(sem.effectsize[which(sem.coef$Parameter == "Arable"), which(names(sem.coef) == "Percent")],2)` for SELM. The effect size is however comparable to the effect of a 10% increase of forest for the LM model (`r round(lm.effectsize[which(lm.effectsize$Parameter == "Arable"), which(names(lm.effectsize) == "Percent")],2)` %) , albeit it remains lower for the SELM model (`r round(sem.effectsize[which(sem.effectsize$Parameter == "Arable"), which(names(sem.effectsize) == "Percent")],2)` %). The unscaled estimates for Forest and Arable are similar, while the scaled estimate of Arable is ten times smaller than the scaled estimate for Forest, the standard deviation of the proportion of arable land being much bigger. 



## Spatial error models with selected predictors



### Spatial error model on Norwegian and Fennoscandian datasets {#sem-simple}

Larsen et al. @Larsen2011a modelled TOC concentration based on NDVI, Runoff and proportion of bogs using the norwegian lakes from the Northern Lake Survey. The previous comparison between LM and SELM model fitted with 6 prefictors confirmed that these 3 parameters have the largest effect sizes. Therefore, we fitted a LM and a SELM model for the Norwegian dataset and for the Fennoscandian dataset based on these three parameters. 

To compare the results of this study to the results of , we fitted two models using only three predictors: NDVI, proportion of bogs and runoff. LM and SELM models were fitted for the entire dataset as well as for the Norwegian subset. The scaled estimates and the effect size were calculated similarly to the previous section.

Once again, the effect size is expressed as % change of TOC concentration for a 10% increase in NDVI, Runoff and Bog coverage. These relative changes are arbitrarily chosen to represent the impact of each predictor variable on a comparable basis.

`r fig_nums(name = "compare-plots-2", caption = "Comparison of scaled estimates and effect sizes from the limited SELM  model based on the Norwegian (green) and Fennoscandian (orange) datasets.")`

In the  SELM model, based on the Fennoscandian dataset with only three predictor variables, the NDVI effect size (`r fig_nums("compare-plots-2",display = "c")`) is inherently higher than in the model including six variables (`r fig_nums("compare-plots-1",display = "c")`).  Including Forest and Arable land coverage and TN-deposition, the NDVI in the full SELM model predicted an `r round(sem.effectsize[which(sem.effectsize$Parameter == "NDVI"), which(names(sem.effectsize) == "Percent")],2)`% increase in TOC (`r fig_nums("compare-plots-1",display = "c")`), while using only the NDVI, log Runoff and Bog coverage in the 3-variable model, the NDVI predicts a `r round(sem.effectsize.fen[which(sem.effectsize.fen$Parameter == "NDVI"), which(names(sem.effectsize.fen) == "Percent")],2)`% increase in TOC (`r fig_nums("compare-plots-2",display = "c")`). The effect size of a relative increase in log Runoff is slightly more negative in the 3-variable model (`r fig_nums("compare-plots-2",display = "c")`) compared to the full model (`r fig_nums("compare-plots-1",display = "c")`) (i.e., `r round(sem.effectsize.fen[which(sem.effectsize.fen$Parameter == "logRunoff"), which(names(sem.effectsize.fen) == "Percent")],2)`% and `r round(sem.effectsize[which(sem.effectsize$Parameter == "logRunoff"), which(names(sem.effectsize) == "Percent")],2)` %), while  the effect of an increase in the proportion of  bogs was lower in the 3-variable model (`r fig_nums("compare-plots-2",display = "c")`) compared to the full model (`r fig_nums("compare-plots-1",display = "c")`) (i.e., `r round(sem.effectsize.fen[which(sem.effectsize.fen$Parameter == "logRunoff"), which(names(sem.effectsize.fen) == "Percent")],2)`% and `r round(sem.effectsize[which(sem.effectsize$Parameter == "logRunoff"), which(names(sem.effectsize) == "Percent")],2)`% and `r round(sem.effectsize.fen[which(sem.effectsize.fen$Parameter == "Bog"), which(names(sem.effectsize.fen) == "Percent")],2)`% and `r round(sem.effectsize[which(sem.effectsize$Parameter == "Bog"), which(names(sem.effectsize) == "Percent")],2)`%). Overall, as expected this indicates that disregarding the role of Forest, Arable and TN-deposition leads to a possible overestimation of the effect of NDVI and logRunoff, and underestimation of the effect of bog coverage.  

Likewise, the scaled estimates and effect sizes of the 3-variable SELM model are slightly higher when based on the Norwegian data compared to the Fennoscandian dataset (`r fig_nums("compare-plots-2",display = "c")`). Nevertheless, NDVI remains the sovereign predictor with the highest scaled estimate and the strongest effect size. That the model using only the Norwegian data is stronger than the Fennoscandian is likely be due to that the full span in the variables are included in the Norwegian dataset with less samples, thereby generating less noise.

When computing SEM models with forest as a vegetation indicator instead of NDVI, the effect size of the proportion of bogs become more important than previously. The effect size of a 10% increase in forest cover is rather small  compared to a 0.1 unit increase of NDVI ((`r round(sem.effectsize.forest[which(sem.effectsize.forest$Parameter == "forest"), which(names(sem.effectsize.forest) == "Percent")],0)`% compared to `r round(sem.effectsize.fen[which(sem.effectsize.fen$Parameter == "forest"), which(names(sem.effectsize) == "Percent")],0)`% for Fennoscandia). 

On the contrary, including the forest instead of the NDVI gives more impact to the proportion of bogs (for Fennoscandia, `r round(sem.effectsize.forest[which(sem.effectsize.forest$Parameter == "bogs"), which(names(sem.effectsize.forest) == "Percent")],0)`% compared to `r round(sem.effectsize.fen[which(sem.effectsize.fen$Parameter == "bogs"), which(names(sem.effectsize) == "Percent")],0)`%, and even more for the model on the Norwegian dataset). The effect size of a 10% increase in runoff remains similar  (for Fennoscandia, `r round(sem.effectsize.forest[which(sem.effectsize.forest$Parameter == "log.runoff"), which(names(sem.effectsize.forest) == "Percent")],0)`% compared to `r round(sem.effectsize.fen[which(sem.effectsize.fen$Parameter == "log.runoff"), which(names(sem.effectsize) == "Percent")],0)`%, and even more for the model on the Norwegian dataset).

## Geographically Weighted Regression

A geographically weighted model was fitted on the Fennoscandian dataset. The objective is to examine the regional relationship with the response and predictor variables. A geographically weighted model computes a linear regression giving a stronger weight to the closest neighbors. The neighbors here are chosen to be the 500 nearest lakes, where weight for each lake is attributed following a gaussian distribution. The local regression coefficients are shown on `r fig_nums("gwr-results",display = "c")`. The map of measured TOC concentration (the concentration in mg/L is logged) is also presented for comparison.

In GWR, NDVI remains the main predictor for the concentration of TOC. All the local effect sizes have positive values and range from 0 to +50%. In regions already forested or agricultural (southern Sweden, south-east Finland), the effect size of a 0.1 increase in NDVI is close to 0%, but in southern Norway an increase of NDVI could have a significant relative impact on TOC concentration. 

Here again the effect size of a 10% increase in runoff is mainly negative, between `r round(min(gwr.effectsize.percent$log.runoff),0)` % and  `r round(max(gwr.effectsize.percent$log.runoff),0)`%. The south-east part of Finland it the only one where the effect size is positive. The most negative effects are located in the south-west region of Norway. 

A change of the proportion of bogs has almost not effect here except for a little spot in south-east Finland where both the highest (`r round(min(gwr.effectsize.percent$bogs),0)` %) and the lowest (`r round(min(gwr.effectsize.percent$bogs),0)`%) effect sizes are found. This local spot is not related to the original proportion of bogs (see Supplementary 2). **there are rather low runoff values in this region, but no outliers of any sort. Where does this come from?**. In all the other regions, an increase in bog proportion would have a very low effect, comparable to the mean effect size calculated with the SELM model.

Replacing NDVI by the proportion of forest does not change the local effect sizes of runoff in the model, and a similar spot of very high and very low effect sizes appears for the proportion of bogs. A similar spot is visible on the map representing the local effect sizes for an increase in forest proportion, but the effect sizes values are not unusual there. Once again, this spot is not explained by an unusual original proportion of forest (see Supplementary 2). The range of effect sizes goes from `r round(min(gwr.effectsize.percent$forest),0)` % to  `r round(max(gwr.effectsize.percent$forest),0)`%. 


### Conclusion GWR

GWR models are interesting to investigate local relationships between the response and predictor variables, but the results might be complicated to interpret. The strength of a GWR model is also a drawback: by giving more weight to the closest neighbors, it also "artificially" emphasizes the local features of the data points, like a magnifying lens, resulting in an potentially exaggerated version of the reality. 
If the local effect sizes of an increase of NDVI, forest and runoff could be explained by the original conditions, the effect sizes of an increase in bogs were more diverse and there is no good explanation for the spot observed in Finland. 


## Forecast in water regions

Based on the results from the spatial error model, we tried to forecast future changes in TOC concentration. The forecast is based on the evaluation of the future values of the three main predictors: NDVI, runoff and bogs. 


In order to cover the whole territory of Fennoscandia, and not only some lakes catchment as with the Northern lake Survey, we used the polygons representing the water regions. Water regions are the ensemble of the watercourse that drain to the sea within a coastal section @NVE. The water regions were computed from an elevation model (ref Anders). After cleaning, the dataset is composed of 1392 polygons (see Supplementary 3). 


### Modelling of mean TOC in 1995 in water regions

NDVI, runoff and land cover for 1995 were extracted the same way as for the Northern Lake Survey dataset (`r fig_nums("wr-maps-96\5", display = "c")`). The TOC concentration was predicted using the spatial error model fitted in [section 3.3](#sem-simple). 

```{r wr-maps-95, fig.scap= NA}
knitr::include_graphics(c("WR/wr.ndvi.plot.png","WR/wr.bogs.plot.png","WR/wr.runoff.plot.png","WR/wr.toc.png"))
```

`r fig_nums("wr-maps-95","Map of the mean values of predictor and response variables in water regions in 1995") `

### Forecast of predictor variables

Temperature and precipitation values were used to model future NDVI, since no forecast exist for this index. The proportion of bogs is not expected to change, therefore no hypothesis is taken concerning their future evolution.


#### Runoff 2041-2060

Future runoff annual values were extracted from the CRMP-CM6 model results and averaged for the period 2041-2060 to match the temperature and precipitation data. The average forecast and the difference compared to the period 1970-2000 is shown on `r fig_nums("future_runoff",display = "c")`.

```{r future-runoff, fig.dim= c(6,8)}
knitr::include_graphics(c("WR/ssp126.runoff.png","WR/ssp126.runoff.diff.png","WR/ssp370.runoff.png","WR/ssp370.runoff.diff.png"))
```

`r fig_nums("future-runoff","Forecast of mean runoff for 2050 (mean 2041-2060) under SSP 1-2.6 and SSP 3-7.0")`

#### NDVI 2041-2060

There is no forecast for NDVI in CMIP6. We therefore fitted a spatial error model for summer NDVI based on temperature and precipitations in 1995 (mean 1970-2000). This model is used to predict NDVI in 2050, based on forecast for temperature and precipitations in the period 2041-2060.

The average temperature and precipitation for 1995 were extracted from the Worldclim database. Future temperature and precipitation values are extracted from the CRNM-CM6 model. They are presented respectively in `r fig_nums("ssp-temp-prec",display = "c")`. The modeled future NDVI are shown in `r fig_nums("ssp-ndvi",display = "c")`. 

```{r ssp-temp-prec, fig.dim= c(6,8)}

### Forecast of mean TOC concentration in 2041-2060

Using the Spatial Error Model fitted in [section 3.3](#sem-simple) for Fennoscandia, we used the values extracted for the two SPP to predict the TOC concentration under two different pathways. 

As a reminder, the mean TOC concentration in water regions was predicted using the same model and historical data. The results are shown in `r fig_nums("wr-maps-95", display = "c")`. 

`r fig_nums("ssp-toc",display = "c")` show the model result for SSP 1-2.6 and SSP 3-7.0

```{r ssp-toc, fig.dim= c(6,8)}
knitr::include_graphics(c("WR/map.toc.126.png", "WR/map.toc.diff.126.png","WR/map.toc.370.png","WR/map.toc.diff.370.png"))

```

### Forecast of future TOC based on forest increase

Even without climate change, an increase in forest cover would have an impact on the TOC concentration in lakes. In this section, we use the model fitted in [section 3.5](#forest) to map the TOC concentration in water regions depending on the increase in forest cover. However, the increase in the proportion of forest cover differs for all the catchments. As a matter of fact, the proportion of forest in a water region with a 100% forest cover cannot increase, and it is likely that a water region with a 0% forest cover cannot be planted (bare rocks, glaciers). Therefore, the increase of forest cover was calculated using a simple equation:

$forest_{future} = forest_{present} + (1- forest_{present}) * forest_{present}$

```{r map-increase-forest, fig.dim = c(6,8) }
knitr::include_graphics(c("WR/map.forest.png","WR/map.diff.forest.png"))
```

`r fig_nums("map-increase-forest","Predicted increase of forest cover")`

This formula attributes a larger increase of forest proportion to the catchments with 50% forest cover (50% increase), whereas the regions with 0 or 100% forest cover will not increase. 

```{r map-toc-forest, fig.dim = c(6,8) }
knitr::include_graphics(c("WR/map.toc.forest.png","WR/map.diff.toc.forest.png"))
```

`r fig_nums("map-toc-forest","Forecast of TOC concentration with an increase of forest cover")`


# Discussion


## Key predictors for TOC concentration: vegetation cover and runoff

* Summer NDVI proves to be a stronger predictor than the proportion of forest. Takes into account more variations of vegetation, even with a coarser resolution.
* Forest cover remains a good predictor and can be used to evaluate the impact of afforestation on TOC concentration in lakes. 
* The proportion of bogs is a strong predictor that cannot be replaced by another. Unlikely to change over time.
* Runoff is a major predictor, but we observe that it has a negative effect on TOC concentration. The dilution effect is therefore stronger than the mobilisation (of soil organic matter) on average. GWR shows that it nonetheless depends on the local slope: the effect size of a 10% increase in runoff is close to zero in eastern Finland and -6% in western Norway.

## Impact of climate change on TOC concentration in lakes

* In the SELM fit, the effect size of runoff is more limited than the effect size of NDVI for the same relative change (10%). 
* However, the effect of an increased runoff dominates in the forecast of TOC concentration in the scenario SSP126. In the north of Sweden and in the east of Finland, where the runoff will increase most, the average TOC concentration will decrease. On the contrary, in the south of Sweden and on the Norwegian western coast, the runoff is predicted to decrease. These are also the regions where the highest increase of TOC concentration. The increase of NDVI is highest in the northernmost catchments, but this increase is not reflected in the future TOC concentration.

* In the SSP370 scenario, the same trend is visible but the TOC concentration will increase in more water regions. The highest increases are once again visible in the south of Sweden. For many water regions, both NDVI and runoff will increase without leading to an increase of TOC concentration, rather a slight decrease, confirming the importance of the dilution effect compared to the vegetation effect. 


## Impact of afforestation / densification / fertilization

* Forest model: allows to assess the impact of afforestation
* NDVI model: allows to assess the impact of densification / fertilization
* More forest -> more TOC in lakes, up to +2 mg/L. Highest TOC concentration in water regions where the forest increases most, even considering that water regions with 100% forest will not have more forest.

Is climate forest the best way to store carbon?

*	according to LeNoe et al @LeNoe2021, limiting the harvest of wood would allow the forest to become a huge sink (more than 20 tC/ha).
*	Afforestation does not necessary lead to an increased storage of carbon in soils @TauStrand2021

# Conclusion

* NDVI is the predictor with the highest estimate in the model, but in the forecast the negative effect of runoff on TOC concentration is stronger
* Climate forest will lead to an increase in average TOC concentration, but this might be balanced but the effect of an increased runoff in the future.
