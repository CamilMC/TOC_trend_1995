## Abstract

## Supplementary information

[Supplementary 1 : Data preparation](https://camilmc.github.io/TOC_trend_1995/main/Supp1-nsf_model.html)

Contains the code used to extact and gather the data, to plot it, and to build spatial models 
(section "Modelling of TOC concentration on the Northern European Lake Survey dataset" in main article)

Supplementary 2: SELM test on data from the 1000 lakes survey 2019

Test the SELM model fitted in Supplementary 1 on data collected in 2019 during the "1000 Lakes Survey" by NIVA
(section "Validation against a new 1000-lakes-survey" in main article)

Supplementary 3 : Modelling TOC concentration and forecast in coastal drainage basins

Data preparation for predictions in coastal drainage basins. Forecasts for 2050 and 2100, prediction of TOC export to the sea.
(section "Forecast with SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0) in main article)

Supplementary 4 : Models and effect sizes

Description of the models and equations used to fit linear model and spatial error linear model. Description of effect sizes

Supplementary 5 : SELM with proportion of Forest as predictor

Spatial error model fitted with proportion of forest as a predictor. Forecast of the TOC concentration in coastal drainage basins in 2100, after implementation of the planned forest policies in Norway, Sweden and Finland.
